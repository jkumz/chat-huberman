Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll focus on the following key points from the context:
1. The importance of experiences over deprivation in child development
2. The role of positive experiences in shaping neural circuits and behavior
3. The impact of play and unstructured time on child development
4. The significance of emotional regulation and social interactions

I'll structure the answer to highlight these aspects and their significance for children's development.
</thinking>

Prioritizing experiences over deprivation is crucial for children's development as it shapes their neural circuits, emotional regulation, and social skills in significant ways.

Firstly, providing children with a variety of positive experiences helps strengthen neural pathways that support healthy development. As mentioned in the context, when children have strongly reinforcing experiences, the neural circuits associated with those behaviors are strengthened, making it easier for them to repeat those behaviors in the future. This process is largely driven by dopamine and acetylcholine, which play key roles in learning and plasticity.

Secondly, prioritizing experiences allows children to develop emotional regulation skills. By engaging children in activities that excite them and also provide immediate pleasure, parents can help balance the dopaminergic (anticipation) and serotonergic (contentment) systems. This balance is essential for healthy adult relationships and emotion regulation later in life.

Thirdly, providing diverse experiences, especially through play and unstructured time, is vital for children's social and cognitive development. Unstructured play time allows children to explore, be creative, reflect, and interact with peers in ways that are crucial for their mental health and wellbeing. These experiences help children develop social skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity.

Lastly, prioritizing experiences over deprivation helps children develop a healthy mindset about various aspects of life. For example, exposing children to positive experiences with healthy foods can help them develop a mindset that "healthy foods are indulgent and delicious," rather than viewing them as a chore.

In contrast, environments of deprivation or neglect can have negative impacts on development. Studies on enriched environments for animals have shown that providing varied experiences and stimuli leads to better brain development compared to deprived conditions.

It's important to note that while early experiences are crucial, development is a lifelong process. Even if a child has experienced trauma or stress, which can make it harder to engage in play or access neuroplasticity, these effects are not permanent and can be overcome with appropriate interventions and experiences later in life.

Retrieved Contexts: ['So this is actually really\nimportant to understand that a baby, when you were a\nbaby, and when I was a baby, we didn\'t have any sense\nof the outside world except that it responded to our\nacts of anxiety essentially.\n\nNow this isn\'t Freudian theory, There are components of it that are embedded in Freudian theory, but all developmental\npsychologists agree that babies lack the ability to make cognitive sense\nof the outside world, but in this feeling of anxiety and registering one\'s own internal state, and then crying out to the outside world, either through crying\nor subtle vocalizations, or even just cuing, making some noise, we start to develop a relationship\nwith the outside world in which our internal states, our shifts and anxiety\nstart to drive requests, and people come and respond\nto those requests, hopefully.\n\nAnd the reason I say hopefully is that we\'ve all heard presumably about these cases of neglect.\n\nThere are a lot of cases\nwhere if you neglect a baby, you neglect an adolescent or a teenager, development doesn\'t go well, and we\'ll touch on some of those.\n\nBut those are really extreme cases.\n\nThey\'re sort of like the\nparallel to experiments that are often done in the\nlaboratory with animals, where you\'ve probably heard\nof these enriched environments where they\'ll give mice a bunch of toys, and they\'ll give them some different foods\nevery once in a while, and they\'ll house them\ntogether with other mice.\n\nAnd then what you find\nis that the animals, they will say, "Oh, their brain is thicker and their neurons have more\nbranches to them and all that."', 'But that\'s really comparing\ndeprivation with normalcy.\n\nWhat we want to center on today instead is what happens when things go well, and why things might not go well in certain circumstances is interesting.\n\nBut to me, not as interesting as what healthy emotional\ndevelopment looks like.\n\nAnd if you haven\'t achieved\nhealthy emotional development, what can be done as an intervention at later times in order to rescue that?\n\nSo the baby, you as a baby, you\'re flopping around there in your crib, you\'re getting care where you need it and when you need it, presumably, and this gets to the basis\nof what emotions are about, which are emotions are\nreally about forming bonds and being able to predict\nthings in the world.\n\nThat\'s really what emotions are about.\n\nWhether or not the baby\nfeels angry or happy or sad, we don\'t know, we can\nguess, but we don\'t know.\n\nIn fact, most of the time we\ndon\'t even know how we feel, let alone how other people feel, and that\'s true for adults.\n\nSo if I asked you how you feel right now, I don\'t know that you could tell me in any kind of rich\nlanguage that I would say, "Oh I really understand."', "- Your child real, real child.\n\nThe real kind of experiment.\n\n- It's how do I resist the urge to force my child to eat her dinner so that she can have her dessert, right?\n\nBecause that's the real urge.\n\nIt's like, no, you need\n- Or you're negotiating.\n\n- to do that.\n\nBecause when you start thinking about it in terms of mindset, you realize, oh, that's just reinforcing to her, that the dessert is the\nexciting, fun thing to have.\n\nAnd this thing that I have\nto do must be horrible.\n\nSo horrible that my parent is\nforcing me to do it, right?\n\nSo it's letting go a\nlittle bit of the behavior, the objective reality, and really thinking about\nthe subjective reality and focusing on adaptive mindsets.\n\nSo my goal as a parent has been to try to help her\ninstill a healthy mindset about eating, that healthy foods are\nindulgent and delicious.\n\nThat the experience of\nstress is inevitable, that it's natural.\n\nAnd that going through\nstressful experience can help her learn, grow, and become a more connected\nand happier individual.\n\nAnd with exercise and physical activity, we haven't really gotten to that yet, but [laughs] we will with time.", "yeah so I think it's it's really I mean I'm I'm so I'm a parent I have two kids that are in public school and I think their Public Schools rated you know it's fine Buton say it's all right and um but but at their school they definitely do get education about um more holistic health and emotional regulation I think and and considering others um that's been that's that's a big focus of the school and I think that's actually really important I I I I mean you know again I'm I'm super biased from from my upbringing but my kids are going to learn math whenever it's time to learn the that they'll learn it whenever they need it you know whenever they need it they're going to learn it in a couple I don't know a couple weeks and figure out do the thing um most of the things that they learn they're going to forget them and then have to relearn them um so what are the things that you're going to really need to know no matter what you choose to do and I think regulating your your own emotions and and and engaging other individuals in a healthy sustainable way that you know and I mean sustainable in terms of the longevity of their relationships and I think those are the things that end up really mattering so I think um also this question about exposure to abundance and scarcity uh is really interesting too I mean I don't know if that's a direction we want to go into so please yeah well I think you know this whole you know it sort sounds sort of new Agy when I say you know abundant the abundance mindset", "Leveraging different kinds\nof social relationships that reinforce positive behavior.\n\nThis is starting to sound like\nkind of a boiler plate stuff.\n\nAnd yet, really the goal is during puberty to encourage as many\nsafe forms of interaction that allow children, teens,\nreally and adolescents, I keep calling them children, but what I mean are children\ngoing through puberty, that allow them to test\nthis thing of autonomy so that they can start\nto make good assessments about their exteroceptive\nevents that they are selecting and how those make them feel internally.\n\nSo they're essentially doing a buffet.\n\nThe buffet has now broadened to not just include the\nevents and experiences that their parents and\nother caretakers bring them, but they can now expand the buffet into things that they\ncan provide themselves.\n\nAnd so adolescence and puberty is really seen as the\nperiod of development in which one self-samples\nfor these two elements that we talked about at\nthe beginning, which are, how do I form bonds and how do I make predictions about what will make me feel good at a level of interoception.", "It's very apparent that\nhealthy social bonding between children and caretaker relies on the fact that\nboth this right brain system and the left brain system are engaged, that there's a synchronization\nof autonomic function, meaning a joining together\nin actual somatic feeling, and that there's a\nsynchronization of experience that's more about some\noutward or external stimulus, like reading a book or\nwatching a show together or enjoying some common\nexperience of a meal together.\n\nAnd of course, as children get older, they're able to access\nmore and more cognitively sophisticated things.\n\nYou can watch a movie with them and they'll make predictions\nabout which characters are going to show up for instance, or you can take to a concert and they can appreciate the\nconcert or play in that concert, and they appreciate that\nthey're being appreciated.", '- It reminds me, as a neurobiologist, was weaned in the landscape\nof so-called critical periods, where early life environment\nvery strongly shapes the brain.\n\nAnd so many studies were\ndone on animals raised in traditional cages with a\nwater bottle and some food, maybe a few other animals\nof the same species.\n\nAnd then people came along and said, wait, normally these species in\nthe wild would have things like things to climb over\nand things to go through, and you provide those very basic elements, and all of a sudden the\narchitecture of neural circuits looks very different, and you realize that were studying a deprived condition.', "One of my favorite things\nabout developmental biology and developmental psychology is that it is grounded in the fact that we don't just have a\nchildhood and an adulthood.\n\nThere isn't just our child\nself and our adult self.\n\nAnd even though there\nare transitions around the mechanisms that\nunderline neuroplasticity at approximately age 25, it is simply the case that development is our entire lifespan, that our lifespan is one\nlong developmental arc.\n\nHow long depends on our\ngenetics, our lifestyle accidents, injury and disease of course, but it is one long developmental arc.\n\nAnd so it shouldn't surprise us at all that how we learn to play as\na 10 year old or 12 year old would impact how we play\nand interact with people as a teenager and a young adult and on and on and on.\n\nAnd that play is the\nplace in which we explore in which we learn play is the substrate by which our nervous system changes us from this hyper-connected\nbatch of neurons, where everything is\nconnected to everything, more or less to a brain and nervous system whereby certain circuits work\nwith immense proficiency and others are less accessible to us.", "And there's a beautiful model of emotional development\nthat was developed by Alan shore professor at UCLA and psychiatrist that

positive anticipation.", "but I worry that right now that we've almost somehow made that kind of unstructured time seem inefficient you know we've set these standards uh for our kids that they need to be uh you know getting fancy jobs and into fancy colleges and making an x amount of money and the path to doing that is you know to be enrolled in X number of activities after school and to do all this stuff in school and their lives are so hyper structured um that I worry that the time to just play to be creative to reflect and think to just have unstructured time with other kids has evaporated and I think that that also is hurting the mental health and wellbeing of our children I love the idea that that unstructured play time could be framed in the accurate context of the nervous system developing the way it was supposed to develop I mean I would argue that um success is going to be easiest for children that engage in the real world more in fact there's great risk to posting everything that you do online we've seen some examples of that preventing people from getting into or staying in college based on things they said or did previously that they shouldn't have said or done um that's those are kind of you know negative highlighted cases but in general um we know that the the nervous system thrives on diversity of types of interactions and social interactions in particular I'm just restating what you just said", "oh my goodness there's there's abundance here of something oh time to learn something new that's right we've we've overemphasized the extent to which plasticity is driven by punishment but the the neuromodulators that allow for plasticity in particular in puberty and as adults are largely dopamine dependent and acetylcholine dependent um the acetylcholine generally increases Focus um broadly speaking I mean does a bunch of other things controls muscular contraction Etc but so what we're basically saying here is that if a kid gets a strongly reinforcing experience I I'd be willing to bet both arms that the neural circuits that help generate whatever behaviors led to that experience are going to be strengthened in one trial to the extent that it will be very easy to generate those those behaviors again okay so this okay thank you this is exactly what I wanted to know to to deepen my the theorizing that I do in the book um so now this is actually the perfect time for us to switch over to the four recommendation the four main recommendations because they build exactly on what you just said they help me explain why this is so important so um so you know I think one one reason why the book seems to be doing very well and people seem to like and pass it on is that it's not just Doom and Gloom it's not just oh we've messed up our kids", "Now, one of the key findings that\nhas emerged from the literature is children that have\nbeen subjected to trauma or immense amounts of stress of any kind, have a harder time both engaging in play, but also a harder time\naccessing neuroplasticity later in life.\n\nThe good news is this is\nnot a permanent effect.\n\nAnd we'll talk about some\nof the ways to overcome that in a moment, but this should make sense to you because earlier we talked about how a high level of adrenaline epinephrine in the brain and body actually inhibits blocks the circuits in the brain and body that\ngenerate play behavior.\n\nAnd when I say that, I mean that in a very concrete way, that epinephrine and adrenaline can actually suppress\nthe sorts of circuitry that can lead to things like soft eyes or tongue out, or the head tilt, or what we called partial postures of being able to engage in, you know, a rough and tumble play, but not take that to the\npoint of outright aggression and damaging the other\nperson or them damaging you."]

Ground Truths: ["Prioritizing experiences over deprivation is significant for children's development as it fosters trust in kids to sort things out and be safe. Statistics suggest that children are more likely to thrive under conditions that allow for experiences rather than facing deprivation, which can lead to a more positive development environment."]

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll focus on the information provided about high-risk environments, particularly the example of Navy SEAL teams. I'll explain what it means for team members to be relentlessly hard on each other in these contexts, emphasizing the purpose and benefits of this approach. I'll also contrast this with toxic environments to highlight the difference.
</thinking>

In high-risk environments, such as Navy SEAL teams, being "relentlessly hard on each other" refers to a practice of constant, rigorous evaluation and feedback among team members. This approach serves several important purposes:

1. Maintaining high standards: By consistently challenging each other, team members ensure that everyone performs at their best. This is crucial in high-stakes situations where mistakes can have severe consequences.

2. Building resilience: The constant pressure helps team members develop mental toughness and the ability to perform under stress.

3. Fostering trust and respect: Paradoxically, this seemingly harsh treatment can lead to stronger bonds between team members. As one example mentions, "athletes often are very good friends and some of the people they respect the most are the folks who they're battling."

4. Promoting growth: By identifying and addressing weaknesses, team members help each other improve continuously.

5. Ensuring safety: In high-risk environments, being critical of each other's performance can be a matter of life and death.

It's important to note that this approach is different from toxic or destructive criticism. In healthy high-performance teams, the hard treatment is task-oriented and aimed at improvement, not personal attacks. As one source mentions, there's "a huge difference between competition that's oriented on tasks which can help us be the best version of ourselves and competition that bleeds into judgment suspicion and mistrust."

This relentless approach is often coupled with strong bonds of trust and loyalty. As Jocko Willink points out, a team that has strong relationships and mutual care will outperform a team where members dislike each other, even if they're equally skilled.

In summary, being relentlessly hard on each other in high-risk environments is a deliberate strategy to maintain peak performance, build resilience, and ensure safety, while paradoxically strengthening team bonds and mutual respect.

this is what's known as stack ranking and um you know this is where people managers are forced to pick the highest performing and lowest performing members of their team and in essence eliminate the people who are at the bottom 10% every six or 12 months stack ranking has thankfully mostly fallen out of favor in in the corporate world but it was very uh Durer um in the late 20th and early 21st century you know up until 10 or so years ago and it still exists in some places and the idea again was if you want people to be creative if you want them to do their best tap into who they really are and who are we really we are really a hyper individualistic again Darwin species it's really stack ranking is a social darwinist approach to management and the idea is well great if you threaten

Ground Truths: ["In high-risk environments, being relentlessly hard on each other means that team members maintain a high level of accountability and rigor, often using humor as a way to cope with the stress. This approach fosters a culture where individuals push each other to perform at their best, recognizing the high stakes involved. It creates an environment of trust and reliance on each other's skills, allowing team members to step up when needed while also being able to rest when others take the lead."]

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll focus on the neurobiological perspective of heightened behaviors and interactions related to neural circuits. I'll draw from the context that discusses:
1. Pro-social circuits and their activation
2. The concept of neural circuits as collections of brain areas working together
3. The role of specific brain areas like the nucleus accumbens in social behavior
4. The interaction between different neural circuits for various behaviors
5. The plasticity and adaptability of these circuits
</thinking>

From a neurobiological perspective, heightened behaviors and interactions related to neural circuits can be understood as the result of increased activation and connectivity between specific brain areas. 

Neurobiologists view these behaviors through the lens of "pro-social circuits" in the brain. When these circuits are activated, there's an increase in neuronal firing, which can be observed through neuroimaging as a "lighting up" of certain brain areas. This heightened activity is analogous to "turning up the volume" on these neural circuits.

Interestingly, when pro-social circuits are more active, they tend to inhibit circuits associated with aversive or defensive behaviors. This creates a kind of "seesaw" effect in the brain, where increased activity in one set of circuits can lead to decreased activity in another.

These neural circuits are not isolated to individual brain areas but involve collections of brain regions working together to engage patterns of behaviors. For instance, the nucleus accumbens and its associated circuitry play a crucial role in decision-making processes related to social interactions, influencing which behaviors we choose to pursue or avoid.

Neurobiologists also emphasize that these circuits are highly plastic and adaptable. The neural circuitry involved in social behaviors seems particularly amenable to behavioral plasticity, meaning it can change and adapt based on experiences and environmental factors.

Moreover, these circuits don't operate in isolation but interact with various neurotransmitter systems. Dopamine and serotonin, for example, are thought to modulate the activity of these circuits, influencing our social behaviors and interactions.

It's important to note that while we have a general understanding of these processes, many of the specific mechanisms are still being researched. As one neuroscientist in the context admitted, while we know many of the connections and brain areas involved, providing a coherent hypothesis or diagram of how it all happens remains a challenge in the field.

to come up with better ones, is what I alluded\nto earlier, is that it was very adaptive when we were more primitive organisms,\nnever mind non human primates, but when we were whatever we were, to be a social\nspecies for basically primarily two reasons, for reproductive purposes, it\nincreased your likelihood of reproducing if you were hanging out with other members of your species in a non aggressive way and for protection against predators.\n\nAnd there may be other reasons, probably.", "Andrew Huberman: So, in thinking about\nsocial interactions and leaving aside anything related to autism, for the\nmoment, it appears that the circuits in the brain that mediate the desire to spend\ntime with others of the same species, maybe even with other species like a\ndog, are fairly hardwired but modifiable.\n\nWe were born with the capacity\nto build them up and that social behavior is highly rewarded.\n\nIs it rewarded through\nthe dopamine system?\n\nAnd what, if any, involvement is\nthere of the serotonergic system?\n\nAnd we haven't talked about\nserotonin yet, but I'd love to bring up serotonin at this point.\n\nMaybe you could educate us a little\nbit about

oxytocin, and that collaborate with\nthe autonomic nervous system to drive what we call\ndesire, love and attachment.\n\nAnd the three circuits are\nautonomic nervous system, we talked about that one.\n\nThen there's the nervous system components or the neural circuits for\nempathy, for being able to see and respond to indeed\nmatch the emotional tone or the autonomic tone of another.\n\nAnd then there's the third category, and this might surprise some of you, it certainly surprised me, but the data point to the fact\nthat the third neural circuit that's very important\nfor establishing

about\nthose neural circuits and what they are.\n\nNow, often when we hear empathy, we think, oh, empathy is really about\nlistening to and really understanding what\nsomebody else is

Andrew Huberman: You're still going.", "- Right, that is a central question.\n\nI can say, at least with\nrespect to the fear neurons that sit on top of the aggression neurons, we know that when those neurons are activated optogenetically, in the same way we would\nactivate the aggression neurons, that there's clearly an arousal\nprocess that's occurring, you can see the pupils\ndilate in the animal.\n\nThere is an increase in stress hormone release\ninto the bloodstream, we've shown that heart rate goes up.\n\nSo in addition to the\ndrive to actually freeze, which is what those animals do, there is autonomic arousal and neuroendocrine activation\nof stress responses.\n\nAnd some of that is probably shared by the aggression neurons\nand the mating neurons, although we haven't investigated\nit in as much detail, but I wouldn't be surprised because they project to\nmany of the same regions that the fear neurons project to, which is a interesting issue in the context to discuss later maybe, in the context of why we're comfortable with mental illnesses that are based on maladaptations of fear,\nbut not mental illnesses that are based on\nmaladaptations of aggression

electrical\nstimulation in an experiment, believe it or not, that's been done in\nboth animals and humans, animals and humans become\nvery, very motivated to get more stimulation of these pathways.\n\nSo this pleasure pathway or\nthese circuits for pleasure are very what we call reinforcing.\n\nIn fact, animals and humans will work hard to get stimulation of these brain areas even more than they will\nwork to obtain sex, drugs, or even if they are addicted\nto a particular drug and they are in a state of withdrawal, the ultimate state of craving, if given a choice, a person or an animal will select to have stimulation\nof this pleasure pathway instead of the drug itself.\n\nAnd that is a major and\nsignificant finding.", "Andrew Huberman: So using that as a\nframework to think about social behavior, as you said, pro social, non aggressive,\nnon sexual interactions involve the choice of a lot of behaviors, but also\nthe suppression of a lot of behaviors.\n\nMaybe you're starting to\nsense what I'm doing here.\n\nI think for people to understand how a\nsingle structure like the accumbens could mediate social interaction and reward\nit, what it sounds like it's doing is rewarding a certain category and catalog\nof behavioral options and punishing, or at least reducing the probability of the\noccurrence of other behavioral actions.\n\nBecause when I go to dinner\nwith friends, if I know them really well, I might hug them.\n\nI might even say something\nmildly inappropriate if I know the context to be safe, right?\n\nBut at a dinner interview or a

really broad\nintegration and testing.\n\nI think this is the key element here, testing of circuits\nfor emotions and reward as they relate to decisions.\n\nAnd I think that's useful because when you look at the behavior\nof adolescents and teens, they are testing social interactions, they are testing physical\ninteractions with the world.\n\nOftentimes they're engaging\nin unsafe behavior.\n\nI would never try and justify that with the underlying neurology, but the neuroscience points\nto increased connectivity between areas of the brain that\nare related to emotionality and to threat

human brain imaging studies suggest is\nactivated during empathic human responses.\n\nAnd the projections of that\narea into the nucleus accumbens.\n\nThat\'s the connection.\n\nAnd we\'re interested in whether\nneuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin may influence this circuitry,\nthese connections that are involved in these "empathic" behaviors, etc. , etc .\n\nAnd we think drugs can be\nused as probes of those kinds of neuromodulatory mechanisms.\n\nI hope this is all making sense.', "Today's discussion explores all of\nthese topics, and by the end of today's discussion, you will have a rich\nunderstanding of how neurochemicals like dopamine and serotonin work in parallel,\nto reinforce that is, to increase the probability that we will engage in\ncertain types of thinking and

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll need to:
1. Identify key differences between social media addiction and traditional substance addictions like tobacco from the context
2. Focus on the social aspects of social media addiction
3. Highlight the differences in biological vs. social addiction mechanisms
4. Mention the differences in addiction patterns and prevalence
5. Note any similarities or overlaps between the two types of addiction
</thinking>

Social media addiction differs from traditional substance addictions like tobacco in several key ways:

1. Addiction mechanism: Social media addiction is primarily a social addiction, rather than a biochemical addiction. Unlike tobacco, which is biologically addictive due to nicotine, social media doesn't have a specific chemical compound causing physical dependence. Instead, it operates on social and psychological levels.

2. Prevalence and spread: Social media addiction tends to be more widespread and can affect entire populations rapidly. As Dr. Jonathan Haidt points out, with tobacco, even at its peak, only about 37% of American high school students smoked. In contrast, social media adoption is often an all-or-nothing phenomenon, especially among younger populations. It's either "none or everybody," and it typically happens as early as middle school.

3. Accessibility and integration: Social media is deeply integrated into daily life and is much more accessible than substances like tobacco. It's constantly available through smartphones and other devices, making it easier to develop compulsive behaviors.

4. Feedback mechanisms: Social media provides immediate feedback and rewards through likes, comments, and notifications. This instant gratification can activate reward circuits in the brain, albeit not as intensely as drugs like cocaine or opioids.

5. Perception of harm: There's often less awareness of the addictive potential of social media compared to well-known substance addictions. As Dr. Anna Lembke notes, people getting addicted to social media often don't realize it's happening until after the fact.

6. Withdrawal and quitting: While both types of addiction can be difficult to overcome, the nature of withdrawal differs. Tobacco addiction involves physical withdrawal symptoms, whereas social media addiction withdrawal is more psychological and social in nature.

However, it's important to note that there are some similarities. Both can lead to compulsive behaviors, and both can activate reward circuits in the brain. Dr. Robert Malenka describes how checking messages on his phone has a "compulsive, addictive quality" similar to a lever press for a mouse in an experiment.

In conclusion, while both social media and tobacco can be addictive, the mechanisms, patterns, and societal impacts of these addictions are quite distinct, with social media addiction being more of a social and psychological phenomenon compared to the primarily biological addiction of tobacco.

Ground Truths: ["Social media addiction is distinguished from traditional substance addictions like tobacco in that it is a social addiction rather than a biological one. Unlike tobacco, which is biologically addictive and can lead to a significant percentage of a population being addicted, social media addiction affects everyone, particularly in middle school, and cannot have just a third of users addicted; it's either none or everybody."]

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll need to analyze the provided context for information on:
1. How gambling affects loneliness and emotions
2. How social media affects loneliness and emotions
3. Any comparisons or connections between gambling and social media effects
4. Specific emotional and social impacts mentioned

I'll structure the answer to address both gambling and social media, their effects on loneliness and emotions, and draw connections where possible.
</thinking>

Gambling and social media can both have significant impacts on loneliness and emotions, often in ways that are interconnected and potentially harmful.

Gambling, particularly when it becomes addictive, can lead to intense emotional experiences. For some individuals, gambling becomes a form of self-medication. As described by Dr. Jonathan Haidt, a gambling addict may feel terrible about their life choices and the consequences of their addiction, but they continue to gamble because it provides a temporary escape. The gambler experiences a brief period of feeling good while engaged in the activity, despite the overall negative impact on their life. This cycle can perpetuate feelings of shame and isolation, potentially exacerbating loneliness.

Social media, while different in nature, can have similarly complex effects on emotions and social connections. Dr. Vivek Murthy, the U.S. Surgeon General, points out that while social media has increased our ability to communicate, it has paradoxically led to increased loneliness and decreased understanding between people. Young people, in particular, report that social media often makes them feel worse about themselves and their friendships. The constant comparison to others online can erode self-esteem, which in turn makes it harder to form genuine connections in real life.

Both gambling and social media appear to tap into the brain's reward circuits, potentially leading to addictive behaviors. Dr. Robert Malenka suggests that social media platforms have likely capitalized on the same reward mechanisms in the brain that are activated by in-person social interactions, albeit potentially less intensely. This can create a cycle where individuals turn to these platforms for social connection or emotional regulation, even when the experience is ultimately unsatisfying or harmful.

Dr. Kay Tye hypothesizes that social media interactions may not be as effective in combating loneliness as real-time, synchronous interactions. The asynchronous nature of most social media communication lacks the interbrain synchrony that occurs during in-person interactions, which may be crucial for meaningful social contact.

For both gambling and social media, there's a risk of these activities becoming compulsive behaviors that individuals turn to when feeling lonely or anxious. Dr. Haidt notes that as young people have moved their social lives online, many have become lonelier, seeking "cheap and easy stimulation" that ultimately doesn't satisfy their social needs.

In conclusion, while gambling and social media operate through different mechanisms, both can significantly impact emotions and contribute to feelings of loneliness. They can create cycles of temporary relief followed by increased negative emotions, potentially leading to addiction-like behaviors. The key difference seems to be that while gambling is more clearly recognized as potentially harmful, social media's effects are more pervasive and sometimes less obvious, affecting how people, especially young individuals, perceive themselves and interact with others.

and I think frankly for many older people too is their experience on social media has shredded their self-esteem as they constantly comparing themselves to other people like when you and I were growing up uh you know in the ' 80s we we compared ourselves to other people too right people have from Millennia but what's fundamentally different now is that in a given day you can compare yourself to thousands of images that you see online that's actually literally what people young people tell me I do roundtables with college students and high school students all the time around the country

is a great masquerader it can look like withdrawal and sadness it can look like anger and irritability it can look like aloofness as well and so it's only when we stop to ask someone how they're doing

Ground Truths: ['Gambling and social media can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and negative emotions. For gamblers, the addiction can lead to a cycle of shame and despair, as they believe that the next gamble could change everything, which creates a false sense of hope. Similarly, when individuals, particularly boys and girls, shift their social lives to video games, porn, and social media, they may experience loneliness despite receiving cheap and easy stimulation, which ultimately is not satisfying.']

Answer: <thinking>
The question asks about laws protecting against child neglect claims for unsupervised outdoor play. I'll need to analyze the context for any mention of such laws, focusing on the parts that discuss legal protections for allowing children to play independently. The most relevant information appears to be in the first document, which mentions an organization called "Let Grow" and their efforts to pass laws in several states.
</thinking>

There are laws in place in some states that protect parents from child neglect claims when they allow their children to engage in unsupervised outdoor play. An organization called Let Grow, co-founded by Jonathan Haidt and Lenore Skenazy, has been advocating for the return of independent play for children. As a result of their efforts, eight states have passed laws that specifically address this issue.

These laws state that allowing a child to play outside unsupervised cannot be used as evidence of child neglect. This is significant because, in the past, ambiguous laws have led to situations where parents faced potential legal consequences for letting their children play independently.

For example, if a parent sent their 8-year-old child to a store alone, and a concerned neighbor called the police, it could potentially escalate to involvement with Child Protective Services. These new laws aim to prevent such scenarios and protect parents who choose to give their children more independence.

It's important to note that these laws are not universal across the United States. They have been passed in eight states, but the specific states are not mentioned in the provided context. Parents should be aware of the laws in their particular state regarding unsupervised play and child neglect definitions.

The goal of these laws is to stop the incentivization of helicopter parenting and to provide more safe spaces for children to play independently. This legal approach is part of a broader effort to restore play-based childhood experiences in the real world, which are seen as crucial for healthy child development.

where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "whatever but um but kids need to be out playing with each other especially Outdoors we evolved in savanas we evolved in different parts of the world we're attracted to Nature um so that's the way it it always was now uh especially if we in the 1950s and 60s America just been through a World War and the greatest way to make people trust each other the greatest way to boost social capital is a foreign attack and of course Pearl Harbor did more for American Co coherence than anything else in history in modern history 911 did that too but only for a little while and then we we lost it um so for a a lot of reasons people trusted their neighbors kids were out playing you know my parents grew up in the depression in New York City the kids were all out playing stickball on the street or in a parking lot in the 1970s there is a real crime wave um crime goes through the roof actually and it goes through the 80s that goes all the way to the early 90s even still you were kicked out of the house to go play um even in New York City all kids went out to play that's just the way it was but we begin to lose trust in each other for a lot of reasons Robert putam wrote about this in Bowling alone the the the the loss of Social Capital many reasons for that the changing media environment air conditioning and television people are not hanging out on their porch in the summertime to get away from the Heat they Clos the door and they put on the AC and they watch TV family sizes are shrinking there are not that many kids around so for a lot of reasons by the the 90s is the key decade where act two of the tragedy happens and that's the loss of the play-based childhood", "most Instagram no so it the the huge time suck is the videos so it's actually Tik Tok and YouTube are counted in this analysis they're counted as social media YouTube is marginally social media it's more of an general information Source but the point is especially the short videos the short videos are really really addictive because the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the house every day to go play my mom would say get out of the house I now realize she wanted space yeah", "but we just need a norm now for for raising the age to 16 we can struggle to do that I'm doing that with my kids I'm saying no for my daughter no Snapchat till you're 16 16 um and she's the only one who doesn't have it it's painful for her and she's 14 um but my hope is that no parent again will be in that situation that in every school a lot of the parents are going to say no no social media till 16 now of course the laws currently state that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract give away your data and make a deal with a company without your parents knowledge or permission but Congress passed this terrible law in 1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy protection act it was supposed to set the age to 16 which is not which is I think pretty reasonable but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement it's the law is written such that as long as the company doesn't absolutely know that you're underage they're fine they're not responsible 13 they're motivated the companies are now the law motivates the companies to not know how old children are there's barely any forbrain at 13 that's right that's right and since all you have to do you just have to be old enough to lie about your age if you're old enough to lie about your age you can go anywhere on the internet because there's no enforcement so I'm saying let's take the age of 13 which is not enforced let's require age verification which is complicated but they're working on that in Britain they've they're mandating that it's going to happen in Britain we'll work out the technical details um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's the one place where I think we really do need law uh because social media is a social trap and if half the kids are on it there's going to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws", "I love what your mom did getting you guys outside um my parents did the same thing too like we I was very blessed to have two parents who didn't come you know they didn't have a lot of resources growing up they didn't come to this country with a lot of

the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out", "so in America and Britain we freaked out about child abduction and child sexual abuse um some of the scandals were real the Boy Scouts the Catholic Church there were cases where trusted organizations were covering up abuse and I recall the abduction thing the carton y thing right and there was a show I think my name is Brian you know about the kid who was abducted and then all he remembered I think it's a true story was that his name was Brian he would just remind himself every night about his real name you know I think they found him eventually in Berkeley mhm not calling out Berkeley I lived in Berkeley for a long time but um seemed to be the discovery of of Abu of abducted kid excuse me in Berkeley uh there are a few other cases there I don't know what that's about um in any of I grew up thinking that you could get kidnapped right yeah which yeah which is so it's I mean it's the most terrifying possibility for any parent um but when I was doing the research for the codling the American mind I found according to FBI statistics there's only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings a year in our whole country because if a child like who would take a child like it's a really difficult crime and you're going to you know who would steal a child from a store you know parents are afraid if your kid goes to the next D on the grocery store going to be how are you going to take a kicking and screaming kid out of a store um it's and yet sorry to interrupt but the show America's Most Wanted I believe was hosted by a guy whose kid was abducted and eventually found dead exactly Adam that's right right so so there was this propagation of this fear like that one of the deepest fears of any parent I can to imagine is is is that that's right but the point is that these crimes are extraordinarily rare it's almost always the non-custodial parent who takes a kid it's a family member because there's a fight within the family um so we fear the wrong things we're terrified of kidnapping um but locking our kids up overprotecting them has spiked the suicide rate so much that the death toll is vastly higher from the extra suicides than it would be if we could completely wipe out kidnapping which again doesn't", "so that's the third Norm is uh no uh is phonefree schools you have to lock up the phone in the morning either a lock in a phone lock or Yonder pouch um if the policy is you keep in your pocket that's not a policy that's just a recipe for constant conflict with the kids because they can't help it they have to text if anyone's texting they have to be texting and the fourth Norm is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real world because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing we have to do is restore a really fun adventurous childhood like you know what you were saying you know you go out on your bicycle you're hanging out with your friends friends sometimes something happens and boy you have memories I mean exciting things happen scary things happen you have memories and you know I worry about like what you know what boys today you know I have a group of Buddy my group of friends that I you know we we still talk about things that happened you know things that amazing things that happened when we were in college or after college and I wonder what boys young boys today are going to say you know you remember fortnite game 27363 where you were trapped in that Elevator Shaft and I had to shoot you out no I don't remember that one you know like uh the the virtual Adventures are just not going to cut it our kids need Adventure they need Independence and Adventure uh where they work out the conflicts themselves"]

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll focus on the key points from the context about mental health trends for girls since the early 2010s. The main aspects to cover are:
1. The sharp increase in mental health issues starting around 2012
2. The specific mental health problems that have increased
3. The magnitude of the increase
4. How this trend compares to boys
5. The potential causes mentioned, particularly related to smartphones and social media
</thinking>

Since the early 2010s, there have been significant changes in mental health trends for girls. The most notable shift occurred around 2012, when there was a sudden and dramatic increase in various mental health issues among girls. This change has been described as a "hockey stick" pattern, with a sharp upward turn in the data.

The main mental health problems that have seen a substantial increase include:
1. Depression
2. Anxiety
3. Self-harm

The magnitude of this increase is quite significant. According to the information provided, most measures show increases in the range of 50% to 150%, with some nearly doubling. This is not a subtle change but a major shift in mental health patterns for girls.

Interestingly, while boys have also experienced increases in depression and anxiety, the pattern for them is different. The increase for boys began slightly earlier (around 2009-2010) and has been more gradual, without the sharp uptick seen in girls' data.

This trend is not limited to self-reported data. Similar patterns have been observed in more objective measures, such as hospital admissions for self-harm and psychiatric emergency department visits. This trend is also not confined to a single country but has been observed across many developed nations, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Scandinavian countries.

The context strongly suggests that the rise of smartphones and social media may be a significant factor in this trend. The timing of the increase coincides with the widespread adoption of smartphones and social media platforms. The impact on girls seems to be particularly pronounced, possibly due to the nature of their social interactions online and the heightened use of these technologies.

It's important to note that while this trend is concerning, it's part of a complex picture of mental health, and individual cases can have many contributing factors. However, the widespread nature of this change across different countries and its correlation with smartphone adoption make it a significant area of concern and study.

2012 in other countries but the girls graphs are very sharp the boys are also up on depression anxiety they're also way up depending on the measure it's usually everything is in the ballpark of 50 to 150% almost all the numbers are in that range um we're not talking 10 or 20% increases here for most things we're talking close to a doubling especially for the younger girls the boys curves interestingly are smoother that is the boys are more depressed and anxious it's but it's not 2012 it it actually often begins begins more like 2009 2010 and then it just keeps going up gradually so that that's a real clue um which we'll come back when we talk about the the boy story um it a lot of people say oh you know it's just self-report um you know just gen Z they're really they're really

mental health in particular in girls yeah so feel free to hit us with the with the scary truth okay sure so let's imagine so in the US we have really good statistics based on annual or biannual surveys there's three or four big ones that allow us to see what's happened since the 70s and so what I'd like listeners to imagine is imagine a bunch of lines maybe a line for boys maybe a line a line for boys line for girls showing the percentage that suffer from anxiety depression or that have self harm those three really go together and imagine these lines they move around a little bit but they're actually pretty stable from the 1990s all the way through 2010 even 2011 there's no sign of a problem on some measures they're getting actually a little bit better because stable and low stable well low you know if it's if they're around say 12 15 % of girls qualify as having had a major depression you know that's much higher than we would like um that's a problem", "but the fact that we see the exact same curves the very sharp uptick for girls um in Hospital admissions for self harm psychiatric emergency Department visits and we see this in the US Canada Australia New Zealand uh the UK um the Scandinavian countries so something happened across the developed World um around 2012 and I keep you know Jee twangy was the first to really raise the alarm she and I keep saying well you know we can't find another candidate nothing else fits the pattern oh and there's actually not just correlational data there's experiment experimental data too", "so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "but there's this whole category of jokes like um you know when joaco was born um the doctor looked at his mother and said it's a man you know or or when jao left for college he looked at his father and said you're the man of the house now you know jokes like that you know there are tons and tons of these right so there's this whole so that's very YouTube male type humor it's it's one hit it's done it gets a ton of likes and it propagates yeah none of this two or three chess moves down the down the road um so it's very clapback sometimes in or in that case building up Joo who doesn't need any more building up but people do it anyway so things of that sort so interested in the in these um in the Nuance here because um you're telling me that girls are killing themselves more they're depressed their increase in suicide is larger boys have a much higher suicide rate so boy many more boys die from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or a bridge whereas girls tend to use pills or cutting their wrists and they and the great majority of girl suicide attempts don't lead to death yeah so are most of the issues with girls and online use social media it's sort of um uh it's despair it's at home anxious sad about self self- critiquing this kind of thing I mean you're telling me there's a a huge and I believe you that there's a tremendous increase I mean he said hockey stick like function um when we're looking at essentially capturing the tip of the p pyramid in terms of like extreme social interaction so take let me I'm not being very very clear here we have these neural circuits that evolved for social interactions that are more heightened in girls they're getting much more of it faster yeah and the consequences are no less and probably even more severe than they used to be"]

Ground Truths: ['Since the early 2010s, the mental health trends for girls have shown a significant increase in anxiety, depression, and self-harm. Specifically, around 2012, the percentage of girls suffering from these issues sharply rose, resembling a hockey stick curve, indicating a dramatic change compared to the stable rates observed from the 1990s to 2010. This increase is described as not subtle, with many measures showing close to a doubling of these mental health issues, particularly among younger girls.']

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I need to:
1. Identify the age set by COPPA for minors in contracts and data sharing
2. Explain how this aligns with current views on kids' social media access
3. Discuss any discrepancies or issues with the current age limit
4. Relate this to modern concerns about children's social media use
5. Provide relevant information from the context about proposed changes or recommendations
</thinking>

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) set the age for minors in contracts and data sharing at 13. This law was passed in 1998 and was originally intended to set the age at 16, which was considered more reasonable. However, it was pushed down to 13 with little enforcement.

This age limit of 13 does not align well with today's views on kids' social media access. Many experts and parents now believe that 13 is too young for unrestricted social media use. The law's current form motivates companies to avoid knowing children's actual ages, as they are not held responsible if they don't "absolutely know" a user is underage.

There are several issues with the current age limit:

1. Lack of enforcement: The law is written such that companies are not responsible as long as they don't definitively know a user is underage.
2. Ease of circumvention: Children can easily lie about their age to access social media platforms.
3. Developmental concerns: At 13, the prefrontal cortex is still developing, making children more vulnerable to the negative effects of social media.

Modern concerns about children's social media use focus on mental health impacts, privacy issues, and the potential for manipulation by large tech companies. Many experts, including Dr. Jonathan Haidt, are advocating for raising the age limit to 16 for social media access.

Recommendations for addressing these concerns include:

1. Raising the age limit to 16 for social media access.
2. Implementing stronger age verification methods.
3. Enforcing the age limit more strictly.
4. Creating social norms around delaying smartphone and social media access for children.

These recommendations aim to protect children during critical developmental periods and address the collective action problem where parents feel pressured to allow earlier access because "everyone else is doing it."

Cino to keep them in don't have a clock don't let them see what time it is keep them in don't let them click over to a link to another site keep them in um we somehow have seeded our children's childhood to Giant companies that have shown that they don't really care about our kids welfare they care much more about profitability and and they care about their customers who are the advertisers and these companies have been granted a special RIT from the King Congress said in in in the in section 230 of the communications decency act in 1996 I think it was Congress said oh and nobody sue you nobody can sue you for what you show to their kids uh there was a reason for that that you don't want AOL to be responsible for everything anyone posts but it's been so broadly interpreted that so far any attempt to regulate social media or any attempt to sue them is seen as like no no", "so I think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here too cuz Andrew my big concern with parents is look we've taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which we didn't grow up with as kids and we've told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this um you know when we were growing up you remember the motor vehicle fatalities were really high uh in America and we didn't say okay you know what that's just the price of Modern Life we just have to accept it and keep moving on with our lives we said hold on we don't have to go back to horses and Buggies but we also don't need to accept this death rate we need to make this experience safer and so we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups like Matt and others across the country that me Mothers Against Drunk Driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts airbags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that help helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents and deaths and that's what we need here too like we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting in place safety standards to protect kids from exposure to harmful content from from the experience of bullying and harassment and that also protect them from features that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use uh which is happening far too often right now we also need a policy that requires data transparency from the company you know researchers tell us all the time that they these are independent researchers they tell us they are having a hard time getting full access to the data from the social media platforms about the full impact of the platforms on the mental health of kids and as a parent look I I don't when we bought car seats for my children when when they were born we looked up the safety data like many parents we wanted to make sure the car seats were safe but if you had told me that hey you know the manufacturers of these car seats are actually not disclosing some of the the data on the impact on children uh but go ahead and buy it anyway", "oh these terrible devices um rather it's about a vision of childhood which is actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the reason why I got this far is because it's a set of collective action traps everyone every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone so the four recommendations I have are four ways of breaking out on the Trap but the first two are really about delaying and getting past this period of plasticity and you really help me see why it's so urgent to delay until late puberty at least so here are the four Norms that I think can break us out of this trap Norm number one uh no smartphone before high school you can give your kid a flip phone flip the Millennials had flip phones they came out fine no access or no smartphone of their own your own you can't have your own and that would even go for an iPad if you give your kid an iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it any you know anywhere in the house and you can take it outside even although maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the point is um the internet is an amazing thing and you know you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids and they can do things on the computer but you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to so it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone let them have a flip phone or a simple phone watch something like that that's rule number one rule number two is the most relevant for what we're just talking about and that is no social media until 16 there is I believe no way to make social media safe for children that is if they're going to be entering a domain in which Prestige is gained by having posts that get the most likes and followers you're making them be brand managers you're making them be performative this is not playful th", 'So,\n- Right.', "It's like-\n- Right. - Well-\n-", 'Like so-\n-', "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep

children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll need to focus on information related to boys' mental health and neural circuits from a neurobiological perspective. The context provides some relevant information, particularly about neural circuits related to sex and violence in boys, as well as general information about adolescent brain development. I'll need to synthesize this information to provide insights on boys' mental health from a neurobiological standpoint.
</thinking>

Neurobiologists provide several insights into boys' mental health regarding neural circuits:

1. Heightened circuits for sex and violence: In boys, neural circuits related to sex and violence are particularly heightened. These circuits have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years and play a significant role in boys' behavior and mental processes.

2. Increased connectivity during puberty: During puberty, there's increased connectivity between different brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex (involved in motivation and decision-making), dopamine centers, and the amygdala. This integration allows for testing of circuits related to emotions and rewards as they pertain to decision-making.

3. Testing of social and physical interactions: The increased connectivity in adolescent brains leads to testing of social and physical interactions. This can sometimes result in unsafe behavior, as teens explore how different actions lead to success, fear states, or other outcomes.

4. Dopamine and emotion: There's a connection between dopamine centers in the brain and areas involved in emotion and dispersal. This relationship is particularly important during adolescence and puberty, potentially influencing boys' emotional experiences and behaviors.

5. Potential for circuit hyperactivity: While not specific to boys, research on bipolar disorder suggests that early hyperactivity in certain neural circuits can lead to diminished activity in those same circuits later in life. This highlights the complex nature of brain development and the potential long-term effects of early neural circuit activity.

It's important to note that while these insights provide a neurobiological perspective on boys' mental health, they don't paint a complete picture. The research presented is often general to adolescents or focused on specific conditions like bipolar disorder. More targeted research on boys' mental health and neural circuits would be needed for a more comprehensive understanding.

listening.\n\nThe reality is that people with bipolar depression very likely have a hyperactivity, that is an increased level of activity in certain circuits within the brain early in the expression of their disease.\n\nAnd that typically, as\nI mentioned earlier, sets in around the early\n20s, although sometimes that can be even earlier,\nin the teens and so forth.\n\nBut that hyperactivity, we think, leads to a toxicity and excitotoxicity of certain elements of the neural circuits that are responsible for interoception.\n\nIn other words, the overuse of certain\ncircuits can lead to a diminishing, an atrophy, or even a death of certain elements within those circuits and it appears that lithium, through its anti-inflammatory\nand neuroprotective effects and through its ability to increase BDNF, very likely protects us against some of that atrophy of those\ncircuits for interoception."]

Ground Truths: ['Neurobiologists provide insights that the neural circuits related to sex and violence in boys have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years and are heightened, leading to more severe consequences in behavior and interactions. They suggest that the underlying issues, akin to an iceberg, are not being addressed, and the effects of these neural circuits are becoming more potent and rapid.']

Answer: 

The relationship between myopia (nearsightedness) and screen time in children is complex and multifaceted. While there is a correlation between increased screen time and the development of myopia in children, recent research suggests that the relationship may not be as straightforward as previously thought.

Traditionally, it was believed that excessive near work, such as reading or using computers and smartphones, was the primary cause of myopia in children. Studies showed that children who spent more time on near activities were more likely to develop nearsightedness. This was particularly evident in Asian populations, where myopia has been described as an epidemic.

However, recent studies have revealed that the issue may be more related to the type of light exposure children receive rather than just near work alone. Spending time outdoors in natural sunlight appears to be a crucial factor in preventing or slowing the progression of myopia. Full-spectrum light from the sun seems to play a significant role in proper eye development.

One study published in the journal Ophthalmology in 2018 found that children who spent about 11 hours per week (or roughly 2 hours per day) outdoors had a significantly reduced probability of developing nearsightedness. This outdoor time doesn't necessarily mean avoiding all near activities; children can still read or engage in other activities outside.

The increase in myopia rates among children is likely due to a combination of factors:
1. Increased screen time and near work
2. Reduced time spent outdoors in natural light
3. Changes in lifestyle and educational demands

To help prevent or slow the progression of myopia in children, the following recommendations can be drawn from the research:
1. Encourage children to spend at least 2 hours per day outdoors in natural light
2. Balance screen time and near work with activities that require looking at a distance
3. Create a healthy visual environment that includes both indoor and outdoor activities
4. Consider the quality of light exposure, not just the distance of visual tasks

It's important to note that while these measures can help, they may not completely prevent myopia in all cases, as there are also genetic factors involved in its development.

how myopic are they how nearsighted are they versus how much time is your kid in front of the computer doing near work how myopic or nearsighted are they and these well-designed cohort studies did

closed than I ever would be with both eyes maybe that's true for most people question I have is is it true that even just a few hours of misalignment of information to the two eyes early in development can permanently rewire the brain unless there are some corrective measures such as patching up one eye and the example I gave is just one but for instance if um uh you know someone injures you know gives a scratch on their cornea and they close they patch the eye and the person happens to be 10 years old is it important to then patch the other healthy eye after the the um you know the scratched eye is feeling better in other words how critical is it to ensure the balance of information coming into the two eyes even on the order of hours or days yeah your story is uh it has some features of uh you know totally usual how we think about misaligned eyes leading to amblyopia where one eye is weaker patching the strong eye so the weak eye can recover but not necessarily fully regaining depth perception and so that part of it is you know quite stereotypical the part of your story that's atypical is that for most kids um an hour to let alone minutes an hour to even an hour to a day if you were I don't know if you were a young kid and you just really were training up on throwing darts and you were just keeping one eye closed to throw the darts you know really practicing for an hour a day it'd be very unusual for that to trigger this kind of either strabismus misalignment of the eyes let alone amblyopia and the strabismus is what's giving you the double vision because they're misaligned let alone the amblyopia of one eye turning out weaker if I had to guess of course not having you know done your exam before that fateful day in the swimming pool if I had to guess I would guess that you may have had some intermittent business and your brain was already getting kind of hit and and you neither you nor your parents may have even noticed it it could be happening you know at other times a day or you're not kind of really paying attention it doesn't kind of stand out in the way that that that day that you got out of the swimming pool you really noticed it and it may not have been that strong it may have been quite intermittent but if you had had some years of intermittent isotropia or turning in of the eyes or exotropia turning out of the eyes that just happened here and there but was accumulating sort of uh damage or failure to connect over years leading up to that day in the swimming pool and that day just tipped you over the edge and you've got double vision you really noticed it that led to an eye exam and an eye care provider and they said wait a second this size stronger this size weaker you've got a little amblyopia we're going to start patching your strong eyes so you can get your weak eye back so for 99.9 percent of the kids who like you know yeah they get a little corneal scratch or they're patching one eye closed or or uh you know anything that's sort of a rare event like that nothing to worry about parents don't have to worry kids can be kids they can play they can do that kind of thing and uh and not have to worry and and it's unfortunate that we can't tell in advance which kid's been having the intermittent amblyopia because we don't do a standard eye exam on every five-year-old who's not complaining of anything

close range that the eyeball lengthens and therefore the visual image Falls in front of and not directly onto the neural retina the essentially the light sensing portion of the of the eye and those animals become myopic or nearsighted what can we say about the environmental conditions in which kids are seeing from the time they're born through let's say adolescents and their teen years in terms

you're outside in sunlight even it's in direct sunlight you're getting a different spectrum of kind of Full Spectrum Lighting from the sun and it looks like it's pretty clear now actually that it has maybe more to do with outdoor lighting time than just near work and so I think that you know we we've we've actually already seen the first couple randomized controlled trials where they're having kids intentionally spending time Outdoors versus sort of Standard Life which you know is going to be often much more indoor time and uh and seeing some effects you follow those kids over a couple of years and the kids who spend time Outdoors are are progressing in their nearsightedness less like they're they're nearsighted prescription is not getting as strong as the kid kids who are spending more time indoors and there's some pretty good biology that's getting worked out going back to animal models more about about how that might be working in the retina in this inside the eye but it's pretty compelling uh concept and and so you know as a parent uh you you may want to be you may want to be telling your kid like okay yeah I want you to read that book or you know if your kids plan on the phone or something like that or the iPad or something like that they're allowed that time okay you can have that time", "In any case, the social media and staring at a small visual aperture is

Answer: 

Dopamine overshoot has significant negative impacts on individuals addicted to activities like gambling or video games. This phenomenon leads to a progressive narrowing of the things that bring pleasure to the addicted individual. As a result, they often lose interest in other aspects of life such as school, relationships, fitness, and overall well-being.

For video game addicts, the initial excitement and pleasure from playing gradually diminish. They may continue playing excessively, but the dopamine release becomes less intense over time. This can lead to a severe situation where the individual only achieves significant dopamine release from gaming, neglecting other activities and responsibilities.

In the case of gambling addiction, the dopamine overshoot creates a particularly dangerous cycle. Gamblers experience a surge of dopamine not just during the act of gambling, but also in anticipation of potential wins. This creates a powerful motivational drive, causing them to return to gambling repeatedly, even when it's detrimental to their lives. The hope and anticipation associated with gambling leverage the dopamine system so effectively that people may continue despite significant losses and negative consequences.

For both video game and gambling addicts, there's a risk of developing tolerance, where they need increasingly more engagement with the addictive behavior to achieve the same level of dopamine release. This can result in a vicious cycle where the individual spends more and more time on the addictive activity, further neglecting other aspects of their life.

Eventually, even the addictive behavior may stop providing sufficient dopamine release, potentially leading to a serious depression. In extreme cases, this pattern of addiction and subsequent dopamine depletion can become so severe that individuals have been known to contemplate or commit suicide.

It's important to note that the impact of dopamine overshoot can vary between individuals. Some people may experience a much higher increase in dopamine release from these activities than others, which could explain why certain individuals are more susceptible to developing these addictions.

Overall, dopamine overshoot in gambling and video game addiction can lead to a significant deterioration in an individual's quality of life, mental health, and ability to find pleasure in other activities, potentially resulting in severe depression and other serious consequences.

aside it's still important but let's just say this you don't have to think about any of those details or names or anything let's just think about addiction because in biology and in Psychology frankly it really often pays to think about the extremes first and then work our way towards more typical circumstances and with that said addiction unfortunately is very common nowadays I just heard a statistic in fact that there is an 8080 percent increase in alcohol use disorder among women in the last 30 years I talked a little bit about this in the episode that I did about alcohol and health again I want to be very clear I'm not somebody that is completely against alcohol for adults provided they're not alcoholics turns out two drinks a week probably fine health-wise zero would be better if we're honest zero is better than any alcohol but two drinks a week is probably fine past two drinks you start running into problems and yet many many people out there male and female alike suffer from alcohol use disorder also called alcoholism the same is also true for things like methamphetamine or cocaine or other types of substance addictions and the same is also true for a lot of Behavioral or what are sometimes called process addictions things like sex addiction or video game addiction or any type of behavior that frankly is leveraging the dopamine system but that engages this Progressive narrowing of the things that bring someone pleasure such that nothing else is really Salient nothing else is really pulling them in in the way that they're video games or sex or pornography or alcohol pick your substance or you know behavior that you see out there or hopefully not but that you might suffer from an addiction too so what's happening in addiction well addiction involves dopamine among other things often the opioid system Etc", "well then we consider it adaptive if it's not well then considered maladaptive some people will sit down to play a video game they really like video games and as they're sitting down they will experience a five-fold increase in the rate of dopamine output from their nucleus accumbens for other people it's going to be a tenfold increase for other people like me who don't like video games very much I don't have anything against them I don't dislike them but it doesn't do much for me it might not cause any increase whatsoever it might even cause a decrease in dopamine so there's a lot of individual variability for sex it turns out to be a range so the typical range that's cited in the literature is anywhere from a four to five-fold increase in the rate of dopamine neuron firing however there are certain individuals for which that number is doubled caffeine is a little bit of a special circumstance because caffeine has the property of not just causing the release of dopamine but increasing the amount of dopamine receptors over time and there aren't a lot of excellent measurements of the amount of dopamine released as a function of caffeine intake in different populations of humans it's mostly animal studies but what we think based on the Gestalt based on the overall picture of the literature is that it's an approximate doubling of the dopamine signaling that's coming out of the VTA nucleus accumens to prefrontal Cortex when we anticipate and when we drink our coffee again I really want to be clear that for all of these things these are relative levels and they are distribution so if we were to plot them out on paper you would see that these are not bar graphs these are overlapping curves to some extent so some people are going to achieve more dopamine release or less dopamine release from one Behavior or substance however it's very clear that cocaine methamphetamine even heroin for that matter are way out on the right hand side of the curve causing enormous increases in dopamine very quickly and the other things that we described have again a distribution that is more leftward shifted on this imaginary plot that I'm creating it's a lot of individual variability however it's fascinating that dopamine is the single molecule that's causing the craving and pursuit and experience of all of these substances and behaviors and the learning of all of that craving Pursuit and actual experience is what predicts whether or not we will re-engage reuse that substance or not re-engage in a behavior or not and how frequently we will do that so that's addiction but if you understand how the height of those peaks in dopamine and the rate to reach those Peaks and the troughs that result and how long the troughs take to get back to Baseline if you understand or a little or all of that you're really in a terrific position to understand how to Leverage The dopamine system for the pursuit of healthy goals and behaviors I should mention one thing about recovery from addiction which is that the reset of all that dopamine circuitry from unhealthy to healthy often involves depending on the addiction 30 days of complete abstinence that 30 days of complete abstinence inevitably involves a lot of pain and discomfort and craving anxiety insomnia Etc that relates to the big trough in dopamine that inevitably occurs now of course there are some addictions such as severe alcohol addiction and in some cases opiate addiction that immediate and sustained abstinence cannot be used as the tool somebody really needs to work with an addiction specialist and sometimes there needs to be a tapering off of the substance for other addictions it can be quote unquote cold turkey and then of course there are other addictions particularly food and sex but sometimes even things like video games for which the desired outcome is not necessarily to eliminate the behavior completely but to set some constraints around the behavior so that it's not occurring to the exclusion of other pleasureful things in life and adaptive things in life and for that there is the requirement for what are called binding behaviors we'll get back to binding behaviors later but binding behaviors or behaviors in which people bind their behavior around a particular substance use or around a particular behavioral addiction like sex Video Games Etc in space and or time in space meaning they might only engage in those particular behaviors in certain places and certain times when it's context appropriate there are numerous examples of binding behaviors in space and time it all has to do with clamping or directing when the engagement with the dopamine releasing behavior is going to occur so what's happening when people decide to go cold turkey or they use these binding behaviors well what's happening is that people are engaging the specific circuitry within the prefrontal cortex that as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode are important for context setting so in the cases of binding behaviors the prefrontal cortex is essentially getting trained up to understand that okay certain things like food or perhaps sex or perhaps video games they're okay if they are done or consumed in appropriate amounts or in particular context that requires the context setting goal directed behavior that the prefrontal cortex is responsible", "Now, there are reasons why you would have brain circuitry like this.\n\nI mean, brain circuitry like this didn't evolve\nto get you addicted brain circuitry like this evolved in order to motivate behaviors toward particular goals, water when you're thirsty , sex in order to reproduce and we're gonna talk\nabout the relationship between estrogen and testosterone\nand the dopamine system because those hormones actually bias dopamine to be released.\n\nThese things and these\nbrain areas in neurons were part of the\nevolutionary history that led to the continuation of our species.\n\nThings like cocaine and\namphetamine are disastrous for most people because\nthey really so much dopamine and they create these\nclosed loops where people then only crave the particular\nthing, cocaine, amphetamine that leads to those massive\namounts of dopamine release.\n\nMost things don't release\nthat level of dopamine.\n\nNow, nowadays there's a ton of interest in social\nmedia and in video games and there have been some measurements of the amount of dopamine\nreleased video games especially video games\nhave a very high update speed where there's novel\nterritory all the time not novelty is a big stimulus of dopamine.\n\nThose can release dopamine somewhere between nicotine and cocaine.\n\nSo very high levels of dopamine release.", "so there's a lot going on going on here um for some for some of them they are addicted and they feel bad for the reasons you were talking about dopamine overshoot or they feel bad when they're not doing the addictive activity so they are compulsively using it just like a a gambler if you're addicted to slot machines your life sucks you've spent all your family's money you're ashamed of what happened you feel terrible oh but if I just get back into the Zone on the slot machine I feel good for that two or three hours that's the most dangerous addiction cuz as it's been described to me I'm fortunately not a gambling addict addict excuse me the Gambler really does believe that the next one could change everything right it's going to it's going to cause motivated reasoning it's going to cause hopefulness that is dashed um so for some of them it is a kind of self-medication as soon as the boys move their social lives onto video games and porn and the girls move their social Liv on social media both sexes got really lonely um it's you know they're getting lots of cheap and easy stimulation but it's not satisfying so what do they do now that they're lonely and anxious", "Here's the thing, when dopamine is higher\nin your brain and body, when you've deployed it through excitement or pharmacology or otherwise, it tends to narrow your focus\nand make you seek more of it in that general theme that\nyou happen to be focused on.\n\nIt could be anything.\n\nThat's the scary thing about dopamine.\n\nWhat can you do to control\nit and to reduce it?\n\nWell, for those of you\nthat are engaging in habits that are healthy, maybe that doesn't\nrequire reducing dopamine.\n\nHow do you define\nhealthy versus unhealthy?\n\nWell, I think the simplest\nway to define addiction, at least by my mind, is that addiction is a\nprogressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure.\n\nAnd a good life is a progressive expansion of the things that bring you pleasure.\n\nA rather simple definition, and yet when we think about\nthe biology of dopamine, dopamine is not unique to one pursuit.\n\nIt's not unique to the pursuit of sex or the pursuit of warmth when you're cold or cool environments when you're too warm or food or social media, it's just a dumb molecule that puts you into this forward state of\nmass, small visual aperture, and a kind of obsessive-like nature.\n\nWhat can you do to counter that?", "So today we've talked a lot\nabout the dopamine system and those kinds of schedules\nthat will allow craving or addiction, but what's\nthe schedule of dopamine.\n\nThat's going to allow you to maximize on your pursuit of pleasure\nand your elimination of pain.\n\nAnd we get the answer to that from our good friend gambling,\nthe reason gambling works the reason why people will\nthrow their lives away.\n\nThe reason why people go back\nagain and again and again to places like Las Vegas\nand Atlantic city is because of the hope and anticipation it's as those are cities in\nplaces built on dopamine, they are leveraging your dopamine system.\n\nAnd I realized that there\nare experienced gamblers.\n\nThere are people that enjoy gambling.\n\nI'll actually just say, I like sitting at the roulette table.\n\nI was take a designated amount of money.\n\nIt's not much, I enjoy playing\na little bit of roulette.\n\nI certainly enjoy when I win.\n\nI certainly don't like it when I lose but I do it cheerly for\nthe pleasure of playing.\n\nAnd I do it very seldom.\n\nI don't have a gambling problem.\n\nAnd if I did, I'd probably tell you but I don't have a gambling problem."]

Ground Truths: ['Dopamine overshoot can lead individuals who are addicted to activities like gambling or video games to feel bad when they are not engaging in those activities. This results in compulsive use, as they seek the temporary relief and pleasure that these activities provide, despite the negative consequences in their lives.']

Answer: 

AG1, a nutritional supplement, is designed to support various aspects of well-being related to both mental and physical health. According to information from the Huberman Lab podcast, AG1 provides foundational nutrition that aims to enhance overall well-being in several key areas.

For mental health, AG1 is reported to support:
1. Energy levels
2. Stress management (through adaptogens)
3. Overall mental health and performance

In terms of physical health, AG1 is said to support:
1. Digestion
2. Sleep quality
3. Physical health and performance
4. Skin health (indirectly, as it's mentioned in one of the video titles)

AG1 achieves these benefits by providing a comprehensive blend of:
- Vitamins
- Minerals
- Probiotics
- Fiber
- Adaptogens

The supplement is described as a "nutritional insurance policy" that helps ensure optimal intake of these essential nutrients. It's important to note that AG1 is designed to augment, not replace, a healthy diet. Many users report feeling better in various ways after taking AG1 regularly.

While AG1 is marketed as supporting all aspects of well-being related to mental and physical health, it's worth noting that the specific mechanisms or clinical studies supporting these claims are not detailed in the provided information. The benefits described are largely based on user reports and the general understanding of the importance of comprehensive nutrition for overall health.

Answer: 

From a neurobiological perspective, the issues related to boys and their mental health are complex and multifaceted. Neurobiologists focus on the neural circuits related to sex and violence, which have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years. In boys, these circuits are particularly heightened and sensitive.

Modern technology, especially smartphones and social media, has created a "super stimulus" environment for these neural circuits. This is analogous to how junk food acts as a super stimulus for our reward systems. For boys, this often manifests in exposure to extreme content related to sex and violence, such as hardcore pornography and violent video games. These stimuli can be incredibly potent and engaging for the male brain, potentially leading to addictive behaviors and difficulties in escaping these patterns.

The impact of this heightened stimulation is significant. Boys are experiencing these intense stimuli at a much faster rate and with more potency than ever before. This can lead to a range of mental health issues, including addiction, anxiety, and depression. While girls also face mental health challenges related to social media use, the specific neural circuits affected in boys make them particularly vulnerable to content related to sex and violence.

Puberty plays a crucial role in this process. During puberty, the brain undergoes profound changes, particularly in areas related to emotion, reward, and decision-making. The hormonal changes during this time, especially the increase in testosterone, further influence brain organization and behavior. This makes adolescence a particularly sensitive period for boys, where exposure to extreme stimuli can have long-lasting effects on mental health and behavior.

It's important to note that while boys have a lower rate of depression and suicide attempts compared to girls, they have a higher rate of completed suicides. This is partly due to the tendency to use more violent means, which is consistent with the heightened neural circuits related to violence.

In conclusion, the neurobiological perspective highlights the unique vulnerabilities of boys' brains to modern technological stimuli, particularly in relation to sex and violence. This understanding can inform approaches to supporting boys' mental health, focusing on managing exposure to extreme content and providing alternative, healthy outlets for these evolved neural circuits.

Ground Truths: ['The neurobiologist perspective highlights that the neural circuits related to sex and violence in boys have evolved over a long period, and there is a concern that the extreme behaviors and interactions are not being adequately addressed. The neurobiologist suggests that the underlying issues, which are more potent and severe, are not being recognized, similar to how junk food acts as a super stimulus, affecting behavior and mental health.']

Answer: 

Based on the information from the Huberman Lab podcast, mental health measures for girls showed remarkable stability from the 1990s through 2011. The data indicates that various mental health indicators, including anxiety, depression, and self-harm, remained relatively constant during this period.

Specifically, it was observed that:

1. The percentage of girls suffering from anxiety, depression, or engaging in self-harm was fairly stable from the 1990s all the way through 2010 and even 2011.

2. While there were some minor fluctuations, the overall trend lines for these mental health measures were described as "pretty flat" until around 2012.

3. In some cases, mental health measures were actually improving slightly during this period. As stated in the podcast, "on some measures they're getting actually a little bit better."

4. The stability was characterized by low prevalence rates. For example, it was mentioned that around 12-15% of girls qualified as having had a major depression during this period, which was considered "stable and low."

It's important to note that this stability was observed not just in the United States but internationally as well. The podcast emphasizes that this pattern of stability held true across multiple developed countries until around 2012, after which significant changes began to occur.

Answer: 

The switch to smartphones significantly altered teen social media use between 2010 and 2015. This period has been referred to as the "Great rewiring of childhood" due to its profound impact on teen behavior and interactions.

In 2010, most teenagers were using flip phones primarily as tools for calling and texting to arrange in-person meetups. Social media platforms at this time were largely web-based and not designed for mobile use.

By 2015, the landscape had dramatically changed. The majority of American teens had smartphones with front-facing cameras and high-speed internet access. This technological shift enabled new patterns of social media use:

1. Increased accessibility: Teens could now access social media platforms anywhere, anytime, leading to much longer periods of engagement. Some reports suggest teens were spending up to 10-15 hours a day on their phones, which was not possible with flip phones.

2. Visual-centric platforms: The introduction of Instagram, which required a smartphone for full functionality, shifted social media use towards more visual content. This was particularly impactful for teenage girls.

3. Constant connectivity: Unlimited texting plans and always-on internet connections meant teens could be in constant communication with peers.

4. New forms of self-expression: Smartphones allowed teens to easily create and share content about themselves, including photos and videos of their activities and appearance.

5. Viral spread of information: The ease of sharing led to faster and wider spread of information among teens, including both positive interactions and potentially harmful content like bullying or risky behaviors.

However, it's important to note that while smartphones facilitated these changes, they weren't inherently problematic. The impacts varied depending on how the technology was used. Some positive effects included increased social support and interaction opportunities. Negative effects included potential for increased bullying, exposure to inappropriate content, and reduced face-to-face social interactions.

It's worth noting that the full impact of this shift is still being studied, particularly regarding how it affects social and physical development of teenagers. More research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of this dramatic change in teen social media use.

risk behavior but it's more the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "so I I point to that it's that 5-year period 2010 to 2015 which I've called the Great rewiring of childhood because it affects everything everything about what children and teenagers are doing I can recall in 2010 I was actually in New York City visiting friends I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting yeah nowadays I think of it less as addicting but almost um like an an OCD of sorts and here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD but the interesting thing about OCD is that the compulsions the behaviors don't serve to reduce the obsessions rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them and in many ways I feel like smartphone use and social media use in particular is a OCD of sorts it's not just habit it's not just an addiction it's an obsessive compulsive Loop so it's already a struggle to pay attention and you know ancient Traditions have have taught techniques to improve your focus your attention we're easily distracted and um you know so I don't work on my phone very much because I I hate to type on the phone and and I'm always at a computer but even for me sitting at my computer as soon as the thinking gets hard as soon as if I'm writing if I'm doing something that requires concentration some little part of my brain says I wonder what the weather's going to be and I go check the weather or you know oh did I get any email I go check my I might check my email you know probably 40 50 times a day and I know that's terrible so the question is is it a compulsion where I feel pulled I have to check it or something bad will happen no it's more like imagine trying to do your work imagine trying to be a kid in school and you have on your desk in front of you you have your television set your record player a walkie talk to talk to your friends a guitar a painting set all array in front of you and your teacher is telling you about you know geometry what are you going to do probably one of these things and so I think the smartphone where a flip phone it's it's a tool you pull it out if you want to talk to someone then you put it away but the smartphone there's no reason to ever put it away talk to us about the scary statistics there's just no way around this yeah", "oh if you're being contacted by strange men around the world who want to have sex with you like that's not good for 11 12 year old girls so it's all these different potential harms and then imagine all these different potential effects S one of which is depression and another is anxiety another is self harm but there's doing worse in school there's becoming more shallow there's uh conflicts with your so there's a whole bunch and then we want to look at the causal connections and what I'm trying to draw out is suppose you we suppose we could quantify the degree to which sheer time just spending five hours a day does that make you more anxious automatically well maybe a little um but that's probably not the main effect so there's a gigantic multicausal network of effects now um I have good numbers for how much the how much teenss are using these devices and these platforms today um Pew in particular did has done a great job of of tracking changes in this since the ear since the 2000s what we know today from both Pew and Gallup is that young people in America are now spending about five hours a day just on social media just social media", "so you can have two parents who are married and living in the same home and may or may not be a good relationship but living in the same home if there's no conflict or that then generally teens will do well or as you're saying there's not necessarily a direct correlation the problem comes in whether parents are living at home together or separated or divorced is if there's conflict and then that conflict tends to result in social issues emotional issues a lot of social anxiety a lot of feeling like I need to do better so that way my parents like me more and we see that with children too that's not just adolescence a lot of depression and with depression can come self-medication and uh self-medicating around other drugs and so on but that generally is resolved if the conflict resolves but as you're saying we're seeing adolescent angst regardless of parenting uh what we really need though it's not a matter of just the divorce or not divorce or the relationship between the parents it's parenting that's important so parents being good monitors being involved in their kids' lives not this oh you're 16 you have a car you can go wherever you want and we're not going to keep an eye on you we still need parents to monitor to pay attention to find out their kids' friends where are they going after school that discretionary time when parents are working and teenagers come home between 3 and 5 or 3 and six tends to be the most risky couple of hours they're it's called discretionary hours where there's no parent around and we don't always know where those teenagers are hanging out so that's more important knowing where their children are and what they're doing and that there's some adult presence some monitoring then whether or not they're still in a relationship my sense is that smartphones have allowed more communication and monitoring between parents and kids but also more interactions between kids and other kids and kids and adults more broadly so is there any evidence that uh the Advent of smartphones is directly creating problems for kids that um has to do with just so much more PE PE to peer interaction or peer to-peer exposure like when I was growing up we didn't have smartphones uh if you did something stupid like that meaning that kids would laugh at it might get told to a small group of people maybe a larger group of people but um in general it just kind of didn't go anywhere you're like a I screwed up and then You' get teased a bit and then it would kind of dissipate"]

Answer: 

Less sleep, excessive blue light exposure, and inactivity can lead to a range of interconnected health issues:

1. Sleep Disruption: Exposure to bright light, especially blue light from screens, in the evening or at night can disrupt our natural sleep-wake cycle. This is because light exposure during these hours suppresses the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood and learning. It also increases sensitivity to light, making it harder to fall asleep and potentially leading to fragmented sleep patterns.

2. Metabolic Disturbances: Even a single night of sleeping in a moderately lit environment can cause metabolic issues. Studies have shown increases in nighttime heart rate, decreases in heart rate variability, and increases in next-morning insulin resistance. These changes indicate that the sympathetic nervous system is overly active and glucose management is impaired.

3. Mood and Mental Health Problems: The suppression of dopamine due to nighttime light exposure can lead to mood disturbances, increased anxiety, and even contribute to certain forms of depression. This is partly due to the activation of the habenula, sometimes called the "disappointment nucleus," which can make us feel less happy and more disappointed.

4. Cognitive Issues: The combination of poor sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms can result in learning problems, difficulty focusing, and overall cognitive decline.

5. Physical Health Concerns: Inactivity, often associated with increased screen time and less outdoor exposure, can contribute to various health problems. This includes an increased risk of myopia (nearsightedness) due to lack of exposure to natural light and distant vision.

6. Circadian Rhythm Disruption: The misalignment of light exposure, activity, and feeding rhythms can severely impact our circadian system. This disruption can affect nearly every aspect of our physiology, from hormone production to metabolism.

7. Mitochondrial Dysfunction: The combination of poor sleep, excessive artificial light exposure, and inactivity can synergistically impact our mitochondria, the powerhouses of our cells. This can lead to widespread cellular dysfunction and contribute to various health issues.

To mitigate these issues, it's crucial to prioritize proper sleep hygiene, limit blue light exposure in the evening, increase daytime exposure to natural light, and maintain regular physical activity.

every once in a while,\nit\'s not gonna be a problem to get bright light exposure to your eyes in the middle of the night, but if you think about\nour lifestyle nowadays and being up late looking at phones, even if you dim that screen, you\'re triggering this activation because your retinal sensitivity and the sensitivity of\nthese neurons has gone up late in the day.\n\nNow, I\'m not here to dictate what you should or shouldn\'t do, but for those of you that are experiencing challenges with mood, those of you that have anxiety, learning problems, issues focusing, the questions I usually get\nare, "How can I focus better?"\n\nWell, we will get to that, but one of the best ways you can support your mechanisms for good\nmood, mental health, learning, focus, metabolism, et cetera, is to take control of this\nlight exposure behavior at night and not get much or any\nbright light exposure in the middle of the night.', "What if you wake up in\nthe middle of the night and you find yourself watching\nTV or on the computer?\n\nWell, in that case, you might\nwanna wear blue blockers, and you certainly would\nwanna dim the screen, but ideally, you're not doing that, it's remarkable the positive effects of getting that bit of\nsunlight early in the day, maybe even also around sunset, and avoiding bright lights, and especially overhead bright lights, between about 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m..\n\nNow, I'm not talking about shift work, I'm realizing that we're probably gonna have to have an entire discussion devoted just to shift workers because there's some\ngood information there about how they can protect themselves against some of the very bad\nhealth effects of shift work, of getting light in the\nmiddle of the night, but we rely on shift workers and they're super important to culture and society and the economy, so I wanna acknowledge them and let you know that\nwe will do a discussion about shift work and jet lag, but let's talk about what light can do in terms of shifting us in healthy ways.", "So while we've mainly been talking about the positive effects of UVB light and other forms of light, now we have two examples.\n\nOne from the work of Hattar and colleagues showing that UVB exposure\nvia the perihabenula can diminish the output of dopamine and other molecules that make us feel good if that UVB exposure is\nin the middle of the night or late evening.\n\nAnd now we have yet\nanother study performed, in this case, in humans, indicating that even if we fall asleep and sleep the whole night through, if the room that we're\nsleeping in has too many lux, too much light energy, that light energy is no doubt\ngoing through the eyelids, which it can, activating\nthe particular cells in the eye that trigger an increase in sympathetic nervous system activation and disrupting our metabolism.\n\nAnd this study rests on a\nnumber of other recent studies published in Cell, which\nis a superb journal, and other journals, showing\nthat during the course of a healthy, deep night's sleep, our body actually transitions through various forms\nof metabolic function.\n\nWe actually experience\nketosis-like states.\n\nWe experience glucogenesis.\n\nWe experience different\nforms of metabolism associated with different stages of sleep, not something that we're\ngoing into in depth in this podcast, we will\nin a future podcast.", "During our discussion today,\nDr. Hattar answers questions that are absolutely\nessential for us to know about our health and wellbeing.\n\nFor instance, how to\nalign our sleep schedule with our activity\nschedule, such as exercise, and how to align light,\nactivity and exercise with our feeding rhythms.\n\nHe presents a new model\nof how light, activity, and feeding rhythms converge\nto support optimal health.\n\nAnd when those are not aligned correctly, how our mental and\nphysical health can suffer.\n\nIt's a discussion that is rich\nwith scientific mechanism, made clearly, of course, so\neverybody can understand, as well as specific\nprotocols to deal with shifts in day length, shifts in activity, and in order to optimize\nsleep, metabolism, and wellbeing of various kinds.", "They also looked at glucose responses.\n\nThey had people essentially\ntake a fasting glucose test in different conditions.\n\nI won't go into all the details, but here's what they found.\n\nIn healthy adults, even\njust one night of sleeping in a moderately lit environment, this hundred lux\nenvironment, caused changes, increases in nighttime heart rate, which means that the\nsympathetic nervous system was overly active as compared to people that slept in a completely dark or in a very, very dimly lit room.\n\nDecreases in heart rate variability, and here I should point out\nthat heart rate variability or HRV is a good thing, we\nwant heart rate variability.\n\nSo they saw increases in heart rate, decreases in heart rate variability, and increases in next\nmorning insulin resistance, which is an indication that\nglucose management is suffering.\n\nSo this is powerful.", 'So the simple way to think about this is you want as much light\nas is safely possible early in the day, morning\nand throughout the day, including blue light, so take those blue\nblockers off during the day unless you have a real issue\nwith screen light sensitivity, and you want as little\nlight coming into your eyes, artificial or sunlight, after, say, 8:00 p.m., and certainly, you do not want to get bright light exposure to your eyes between 11:00 p.m. and\n4:00 a.m., and here\'s why, David Berson, who I mentioned before, and another and friend and\ncolleague, Samer Hattar, who\'s director of the chronobiology unit at the National Institutes\nof Mental Health published a paper in\n"Cell," which is a journal, another excellent journal,\nvery high stringency, showing that light that\narrives to the eyes between 11:00 p.m. and\n4:00 a.m., approximately, suppresses the release of dopamine, this neuromodulator\nthat makes us feel good, and it\'s sort of an\nendogenous antidepressant, and can inhibit learning and create all sorts of\nother detrimental effects, it does this through a mechanism, for those of you that wanna\nknow the neural pathways, that involves light to the eyes that\'s then signaled to a\nstructure called the habenula, the habenula looks like\ntwo little bat ears sitting right in the middle\nof a structure in your brain called the thalamus, don\'t worry about these names if you\'re not interested in this stuff, if you are, these are\njust avenues to explore, when that habenula gets activated it\'s actually called the\ndisappointment nucleus because it actually\nmakes us feel less happy and more disappointed, and can lead to certain\nforms of depression in the wakeful state.', "Many people are experiencing\nsevere vision problems, because they're not getting\nenough sunlight during the day.\n\nThey have sleep problems, because they're not viewing\nsunlight early in the day.\n\nAnd as I've mentioned\nin previous episodes, they're getting a lot of\nartificial stimulation, artificial light stimulation, of the eye in the middle of the night, all of this is through the visual system.\n\nSo migraines, fatigue, challenges with your eyesight\ngetting worse as you age, or even in young people, there's a, you know, at least according to the articles, they describe it as\nthis epidemic of myopia can largely be dealt\nwith by getting outside, going into panoramic vision, experiencing some distanced vision, look at things off in the horizon.\n\nIf you're walking or hiking or biking, not looking at your phone the whole time that you're doing that.\n\nIf you're at the bus\nstop or you're commuting, certainly not looking at your phone the entire time you're doing that.\n\nSo this is vital.", "Why am I throwing out all this verbiage?\n\nWell, because people have\nasked for more mechanisms.\n\nSo, if you really want to know, when you look at blue light or if blue light is getting\nin through your eyelids in the middle of the night, it is likely distorting this lens accommodation\nmechanism in the eye and leading to myopia in some cases.\n\nSo, that's one reason to\navoid blue light exposure and bright light exposure,\neven nightlight exposure, in middle of the night.\n\nViewing any light of bright intensity between the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM on a consistent basis is\ngoing to suppress dopamine, because of the way that that light activates these melanopsin cells, and the habenula, and the dopamine system.\n\nSo it's all very simple, get as much bright light\nas you can safely, right?\n\nYou never want to look\nat any light so bright that it's painful look\nat, during the daytime.\n\nTry and go without sunglasses,\nunless you need them.\n\nNow, I wear sunglasses for sake of sport and sake when it's really bright out, but I try to get two hours a day of working outside or being outside, even if there's cloud cover,\nthat's going to offset myopia.\n\nIt's going to help you get better sleep.\n\nIt's going to support mood\nand metabolism, et cetera.", "Now let's talk about\nthe bad effects of light because light is not supposed\nto arrive in our system at any time, and nowadays, because of\nscreens and artificial light, we have access to light\nat times of day and night that normally we wouldn't.\n\nNow, earlier I said that\nyou need a lot of light, in particular, sunlight, to set these clock mechanisms, that's true, but there's a\nkind of diabolical feature to the way all of this works, which is the longer you've been awake, the more sensitive your retina\nand these cells are to light, so that if you've been\nawake for 10, 12, 14 hours, it becomes very easy for\neven a small amount of light coming from a screen or\nfrom an overhead light to trigger the activation of the clock and make you feel like\nyou wanna stay up later, make it harder to fall asleep, and disrupt your sleep pattern, okay?", "and So currently what's happening is that our environment the environment that our cells exist in across every single facet of our life over the past 50 to 75 years has changed rapidly you look at how our food system has changed from whole real food in good soil to Industrial food our sleep habits have changed we're sleeping less it's very fragmented our movement patterns have changed we're sitting 80% of the waking day our time in nature has changed we actually are indoors As Americans 93% of a 24-hour periods that totally changes our relationship with light we have 80,000 synthetic toxins in our food water air personal care products home care products we live a Thermon neutral existence now with our thermostats there's no real swings in temperature unless you're in intentionally trying to um and then our emotional health is very different we are very much exposed to lowgrade chronic stress triggers so across food sleep movement emotional health toxins light and temperature things are not what they once were and it's changed in the blink of an eye I mean the light bulb was created in 1806 this is like 0.04% of human history that we' even had artificial light so things have changed and the the unique thing about all of these Chang in our environment is that each one of those pillars each of those changes in our environment synergistically directly hurts the mitochondria through different mechanisms The Chronic low-grade stress the sitting the ultr processed nutrient devoid food even the the blue light at nighttime all of it through different core biologic mechanisms synergistically hits this part of the cell the mitochondria", "- So this is the way you\njustify staying out late every once in a while.\n\n- Well, in the meetings you've seen me in, I've done this for five\nor six days continuously, but what you didn't see that\nwhen I came back to my home, it took me two weeks\nas if I did a jet lag.\n\nSo I really do suffer for two weeks after doing a six crazy\nnight of staying up at night, drinking at the wrong time of the day.\n\nSo it's not that I'm\ncompletely okay with it.\n\nWhen I go back, everything goes back.\n\nIt takes me actually\nliterally two weeks to recover from the circadian rhythm meeting that you've seen me\npartying at some point.\n\n- Which is kind of ironic\nthat the circadian rhythm- - I know.\n\n- Meaning people are totally disrupting their circadian cycle, but scientists are human beings too.\n\n- Right, so I think if you do\nit at very little occasions, I think you should not worry too much that this will have lasting impact.\n\nAnd the good news is that if\nyou readjust your schedule, you could come back to it.\n\nThe problem is when you\nmaintain this wrong schedule for a prolonged time\nand it becomes chronic, prolonged periods of time, that's when you have the problems and the accumulation of the problems.\n\nSo when you have sleeping problem, you produce metabolic problem.\n\nWhen you have metabolic problems, you produce lack of exercise.\n\nAnd you could see how things\ncan spiral out very quickly.\n\nAnd then it would be\nhard to come back to it. -\n\nWell, certainly sleep disruption is both a symptom of and-\n- Yes. -\n\nA cause of almost all-\n- Absolutely. - Mental health disorders.\n\n- Absolutely. -\n\nAnd certainly the metabolic syndromes that people are talking about\nnowadays and all of this, it all funnels back to light.\n\nThis is what's so remarkable."]

Answer: 

Outdoor adventures in childhood have a significant positive impact on memories and independence, especially when compared to the increasing digital reliance we see today. 

Unstructured playtime outdoors provides children with crucial experiences that foster independence and create lasting memories. When children are allowed to explore their neighborhoods, ride bicycles, and engage in free play, they learn essential life skills. These include negotiating situations with peers, resolving conflicts, recognizing social cues, and collaborating with others. These experiences contribute to the development of self-supervision skills and the ability to navigate real-world situations independently.

Dr. Jonathan Haidt emphasizes the importance of "restoring a really fun adventurous childhood" where exciting and sometimes scary things happen, creating vivid memories that last a lifetime. He contrasts this with the virtual adventures children experience through video games, suggesting that these digital experiences are not as impactful or memorable.

The shift towards a more digitally reliant childhood, particularly since 2010-2012, has led to what Dr. Haidt calls a "phone-based childhood." Children now spend an average of 5-7 hours per day on social media alone, with total screen time often reaching 7-10 hours daily. This extensive digital engagement is described as "incompatible with healthy human development."

Digital reliance can limit the opportunities for real-world experiences and independence. The constant connection to devices can interfere with the development of crucial social skills and reduce the time spent in unstructured play. This shift has been so dramatic that some experts are calling for a return to more traditional, play-based childhoods with increased independence and real-world adventures.

It's worth noting that outdoor experiences, particularly in nature, have additional benefits. They can reduce anxiety, improve vision (reducing myopia), and help regulate circadian rhythms. These benefits further underscore the importance of outdoor adventures in childhood development.

In conclusion, outdoor adventures in childhood appear to have a strong positive impact on memory formation and the development of independence. In contrast, excessive digital reliance may hinder these aspects of child development by reducing opportunities for real-world experiences and unstructured play.

the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the

years I don't mean that it won't be seven-year-olds on phones but in the same way that we flipped on smoking we used to think it was okay to smoke in an airplane uh we used to think it was okay to smoke in restaurants it was okay to smoke everywhere we thought um and now we don't we don't think that anymore that took a long time to change but it did change I think because of the public disgust with seeing children just spending their childhood looking at a screen and because the public disgust with what we've heard about meta and and Tik Tok and a few of the other companies um I think within two years it's going to be widespread it'll be a norm that you just don't give kids social media in particular I mean iPads are complicated because you know you want kids you know to watch movies is okay stories are good I'm not saying the you know iPad is a terrible thing but um our attitudes about this are going to change radically um and I think the great majority of schools are going to be phone free within two years um and we're going to see we're already seeing more kids outside lot every day I get I get emails from Greatful parents saying you know because of your book me know my six-year-old he wanted to ride his bicycle down to the end of our cesac he wanted to ride down Circle and come back and I never would let him because I was afraid that what what would the neighbors say but once I read your book I decided to let him and he was so ecstatic he kept doing it and doing it and now he's going further and he rides to his friends houses so people in her neighborhood now they're seeing a kid on a bicycle and if Suppose there were 10 kids doing it well now it's normal so we can renormalize human childhood in the real world where our kids get the chance

that then sell back the illusion of some sense of agency little by little right a temporary agency and then puts you back into the cycle and there's something about going into nature which just um removes one from all of that at least temporarily gives you a more basic understanding of the relationship to self and things around us even just looking being able to see it to a distance we know is

practice of\nputting your feet on the Earth directly with bare\nfeet, oftentimes into soil or on a lawn.\n\nAnd it\'s a question that I\nseem to get more and more.\n\nIn fact, every week for quite a\nlong while now, on social media or elsewhere, somebody asks me\nabout the scientific support for this practice of grounding.\n\nSo obviously there\'s\na lot of interest in what the scientific research\nsays about getting into nature and putting one\'s\nfeet on the ground, a.k.a. grounding, and so on.', "but I worry that right now that we've almost somehow made that kind of unstructured time seem inefficient you know we've set these standards uh for our kids that they need to be uh you know getting fancy jobs and into fancy colleges and making an x amount of money and the path to doing that is you know to be enrolled in X number of activities after school and to do all this stuff in school and their lives are so hyper structured um that I worry that the time to just play to be creative to reflect and think to just have unstructured time with other kids has evaporated and I think that that also is hurting the mental health and wellbeing of our children I love the idea that that unstructured play time could be framed in the accurate context of the nervous system developing the way it was supposed to develop I mean I would argue that um success is going to be easiest for children that engage in the real world more in fact there's great risk to posting everything that you do online we've seen some examples of that preventing people from getting into or staying in college based on things they said or did previously that they shouldn't have said or done um that's those are kind of you know negative highlighted cases but in general um we know that the the nervous system thrives on diversity of types of interactions and social interactions in particular I'm just restating what you just said", '- It reminds me, as a neurobiologist, was weaned in the landscape\nof so-called critical periods, where early life environment\nvery strongly shapes the brain.\n\nAnd so many studies were\ndone on animals raised in traditional cages with a\nwater bottle and some food, maybe a few other animals\nof the same species.\n\nAnd then people came along and said, wait, normally these species in\nthe wild would have things like things to climb over\nand things to go through, and you provide those very basic elements, and all of a sudden the\narchitecture of neural circuits looks very different, and you realize that were studying a deprived condition.', "whatever but um but kids need to be out playing with each other especially Outdoors we evolved in savanas we evolved in different parts of the world we're attracted to Nature um so that's the way it it always was now uh especially if we in the 1950s and 60s America just been through a World War and the greatest way to make people trust each other the greatest way to boost social capital is a foreign attack and of course Pearl Harbor did more for American Co coherence than anything else in history in modern history 911 did that too but only for a little while and then we we lost it um so for a a lot of reasons people trusted their neighbors kids were out playing you know my parents grew up in the depression in New York City the kids were all out playing stickball on the street or in a parking lot in the 1970s there is a real crime wave um crime goes through the roof actually and it goes through the 80s that goes all the way to the early 90s even still you were kicked out of the house to go play um even in New York City all kids went out to play that's just the way it was but we begin to lose trust in each other for a lot of reasons Robert putam wrote about this in Bowling alone the the the the loss of Social Capital many reasons for that the changing media environment air conditioning and television people are not hanging out on their porch in the summertime to get away from the Heat they Clos the door and they put on the AC and they watch TV family sizes are shrinking there are not that many kids around so for a lot of reasons by the the 90s is the key decade where act two of the tragedy happens and that's the loss of the play-based childhood"]

Ground Truths: ["Outdoor adventures in childhood create lasting memories and foster independence, as they involve real-life experiences and challenges that children navigate themselves. In contrast, reliance on digital experiences, such as video games, does not provide the same depth of memory or personal growth, leading to concerns about the impact of technology on children's development and social skills."]

Answer: 

Youth's compulsive digital habits, particularly excessive smartphone and social media use, have significant negative effects on their emotional well-being. Research indicates that adolescents are spending an average of 3.5 hours per day on social media alone, with many using it for far longer periods. This excessive use is associated with a range of emotional and psychological issues.

One of the most concerning impacts is on mental health. Studies have shown that adolescents who use social media for 3 hours or more per day have double the risk of experiencing anxiety or depression symptoms. This increased risk is likely due to various factors, including disrupted sleep patterns, constant comparison with others, and exposure to potentially harmful content.

The compulsive nature of digital use among youth is evident in their behavior. Many adolescents report staying up until midnight or later on weeknights using their devices, primarily for social media. This habit significantly disrupts their sleep patterns, which is crucial for mental health and overall well-being, especially during the critical developmental stages of adolescence.

Self-esteem and body image are also negatively affected by compulsive digital habits. Nearly half of adolescents report that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image. This issue, once primarily affecting girls, is now increasingly observed in boys as well. The constant comparison to others online and exposure to unrealistic standards of appearance contribute to these negative self-perceptions.

The impact on social interactions is another area of concern. While digital platforms can provide opportunities for connection, they often lead to shallow relationships and decreased face-to-face interactions. Many young people report feeling lonely despite being constantly connected online. This paradox suggests that digital interactions may not fulfill the deep social needs that are crucial for emotional well-being.

Furthermore, the compulsive use of digital devices can be likened to a form of obsessive-compulsive behavior. Users often feel compelled to check their devices frequently, even when it interferes with other activities or thought processes. This constant distraction can lead to difficulties in concentration and may negatively impact academic performance.

It's important to note that while these digital habits have clear negative impacts, they are not uniformly harmful for all youth. Some young people, particularly those from marginalized communities, may find valuable support and self-expression opportunities through these platforms. However, the overall trend suggests that the current level of digital engagement among youth is generally detrimental to their emotional well-being.

In conclusion, the compulsive digital habits of youth, characterized by excessive smartphone and social media use, are significantly impacting their emotional well-being. From increased risks of anxiety and depression to negative effects on self-esteem, sleep, and social interactions, the evidence points to a concerning trend that requires attention from parents, educators, and policymakers.

Contexts: ["so there's a lot going on going on here um for some for some of them they are addicted and they feel bad for the reasons you were talking about dopamine overshoot or they feel bad when they're not doing the addictive activity so they are compulsively using it just like a a gambler if you're addicted to slot machines your life sucks you've spent all your family's money you're ashamed of what happened you feel terrible oh but if I just get back into the Zone on the slot machine I feel good for that two or three hours that's the most dangerous addiction cuz as it's been described to me I'm fortunately not a gambling addict addict excuse me the Gambler really does believe that the next one could change everything right it's going to it's going to cause motivated reasoning it's going to cause hopefulness that is dashed um so for some of them it is a kind of self-medication as soon as the boys move their social lives onto video games and porn and the girls move their social Liv on social media both sexes got really lonely um it's you know they're getting lots of cheap and easy stimulation but it's not satisfying so what do they do now that they're lonely and anxious", "but there's this concept of wordlessness of The Importance of Being in states of wordlessness where we're not reading we're not thinking in complete sentences we're not um taking in sensory information and we under those conditions are able to actually register how we feel about things like we become better tuned to um sense our environment and input when it comes and I wonder because my experience of social media has been whether or not kids are on Instagram Snapchat Etc and they're doing it out of whatever compulsion have addiction whatever you want to call it but I'm not sure it feels good to them I'm not sure it does I'm not sure it's like the ice cream that tastes delicious I think it might start that way and occasionally you know they're jackpots right but that in large part adults but since we're talking about kids let's talk about kids in this very critical sensitive period of Life are not feeling good and they might not even know they're not feeling good they're just compulsively there I'm using the term loosely not clinically compulsively engaging and so I wonder whether or not there's some benefit to kids not just being bored for experiencing boredom sake but learning to actually be a better sensor of what they like and don't like because when I talk to my niece or I talk to other young people now they they seem to be like becoming increasingly aware of how much some of the online stuff sucks that's the language they're not like oh it's awesome don't take it away from me they're like I don't want to miss out but it's also painful to them it's I mean it's like they're drinking from a fire hose of nails and then every once in a while there's something that tastes good it's it's not like they're like this is so cool and that's so cool but of course if you give them a really cool video of a animal thing or a social dynamics thing or a war game or whatever they'll get excited but I don't get the impression that they're like this is awesome it's more like this has me by the short hairs it's got me scruffed and I'm just doing it and I don't know how to stop that's that's and that's certainly the way sorry the certainly the way that boys reach out guys young guys typically reach out about their porn addictions I hear about this thousands of messages help me get over this so I refer them to our episode on addiction by Dr Anna lmy from Stanford yeah she's amazing that episode yeah she's she's spectacular or um it's just they're desperate they're desperate so I don't see it as all pleasure I see it as mostly pain that's right"]

Retrieved Contexts: ["oh if you're being contacted by strange men around the world who want to have sex with you like that's not good for 11 12 year old girls so it's all these different potential harms and then imagine all these different potential effects S one of which is depression and another is anxiety another is self harm but there's doing worse in school there's becoming more shallow there's uh conflicts with your so there's a whole bunch and then we want to look at the causal connections and what I'm trying to draw out is suppose you we suppose we could quantify the degree to which sheer time just spending five hours a day does that make you more anxious automatically well maybe a little um but that's probably not the main effect so there's a gigantic multicausal network of effects now um I have good numbers for how much the how much teenss are using these devices and these platforms today um Pew in particular did has done a great job of of tracking changes in this since the ear since the 2000s what we know today from both Pew and Gallup is that young people in America are now spending about five hours a day just on social media just social media", "so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", "so I I point to that it's that 5-year period 2010 to 2015 which I've called the Great rewiring of childhood because it affects everything everything about what children and teenagers are doing I can recall in 2010 I was actually in New York City visiting friends I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting yeah nowadays I think of it less as addicting but almost um like an an OCD of sorts and here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD but the interesting thing about OCD is that the compulsions the behaviors don't serve to reduce the obsessions rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them and in many ways I feel like smartphone use and social media use in particular is a OCD of sorts it's not just habit it's not just an addiction it's an obsessive compulsive Loop so it's already a struggle to pay attention and you know ancient Traditions have have taught techniques to improve your focus your attention we're easily distracted and um you know so I don't work on my phone very much because I I hate to type on the phone and and I'm always at a computer but even for me sitting at my computer as soon as the thinking gets hard as soon as if I'm writing if I'm doing something that requires concentration some little part of my brain says I wonder what the weather's going to be and I go check the weather or you know oh did I get any email I go check my I might check my email you know probably 40 50 times a day and I know that's terrible so the question is is it a compulsion where I feel pulled I have to check it or something bad will happen no it's more like imagine trying to do your work imagine trying to be a kid in school and you have on your desk in front of you you have your television set your record player a walkie talk to talk to your friends a guitar a painting set all array in front of you and your teacher is telling you about you know geometry what are you going to do probably one of these things and so I think the smartphone where a flip phone it's it's a tool you pull it out if you want to talk to someone then you put it away but the smartphone there's no reason to ever put it away talk to us about the scary statistics there's just no way around this yeah", "so you can have two parents who are married and living in the same home and may or may not be a good relationship but living in the same home if there's no conflict or that then generally teens will do well or as you're saying there's not necessarily a direct correlation the problem comes in whether parents are living at home together or separated or divorced is if there's conflict and then that conflict tends to result in social issues emotional issues a lot of social anxiety a lot of feeling like I need to do better so that way my parents like me more and we see that with children too that's not just adolescence a lot of depression and with depression can come self-medication and uh self-medicating around other drugs and so on but that generally is resolved if the conflict resolves but as you're saying we're seeing adolescent angst regardless of parenting uh what we really need though it's not a matter of just the divorce or not divorce or the relationship between the parents it's parenting that's important so parents being good monitors being involved in their kids' lives not this oh you're 16 you have a car you can go wherever you want and we're not going to keep an eye on you we still need parents to monitor to pay attention to find out their kids' friends where are they going after school that discretionary time when parents are working and teenagers come home between 3 and 5 or 3 and six tends to be the most risky couple of hours they're it's called discretionary hours where there's no parent around and we don't always know where those teenagers are hanging out so that's more important knowing where their children are and what they're doing and that there's some adult presence some monitoring then whether or not they're still in a relationship my sense is that smartphones have allowed more communication and monitoring between parents and kids but also more interactions between kids and other kids and kids and adults more broadly so is there any evidence that uh the Advent of smartphones is directly creating problems for kids that um has to do with just so much more PE PE to peer interaction or peer to-peer exposure like when I was growing up we didn't have smartphones uh if you did something stupid like that meaning that kids would laugh at it might get told to a small group of people maybe a larger group of people but um in general it just kind of didn't go anywhere you're like a I screwed up and then You' get teased a bit and then it would kind of dissipate", "so there's a lot going on going on here um for some for some of them they are addicted and they feel bad for the reasons you were talking about dopamine overshoot or they feel bad when they're not doing the addictive activity so they are compulsively using it just like a a gambler if you're addicted to slot machines your life sucks you've spent all your family's money you're ashamed of what happened you feel terrible oh but if I just get back into the Zone on the slot machine I feel good for that two or three hours that's the most dangerous addiction cuz as it's been described to me I'm fortunately not a gambling addict addict excuse me the Gambler really does believe that the next one could change everything right it's going to it's going to cause motivated reasoning it's going to cause hopefulness that is dashed um so for some of them it is a kind of self-medication as soon as the boys move their social lives onto video games and porn and the girls move their social Liv on social media both sexes got really lonely um it's you know they're getting lots of cheap and easy stimulation but it's not satisfying so what do they do now that they're lonely and anxious", "There are some studies\nand one in particular that I'd like to highlight one was actually carried\nout pretty early in 2014.\n\nThis is a study that\nexplored smartphone use at the time they called\nit mobile phone use, but smartphone use and inattention, difficulties in attending\nin 7,102 adolescents that's a huge study, a population based cross-sectional study and you will be probably\nsurprised and somewhat dismayed to hear that in order\nto avoid this decrease in attentional capacity, adolescents needed to use their smartphone for less than 60 minutes per day, in order to stay focused and\ncentered on their other tasks.\n\nOtherwise they started to really run into significant issues.\n\nSo 60 minutes is not much, I've a feeling that most young people are using their phone more\nthan 60 minutes per day, I know I am.\n\nI think for adults, the number's probably higher\nmeaning if you're an adult, I'm going to just extrapolate\nfrom what I read in this study.\n\nIt seems that probably two\nhours a day on the phone would be the upper limit beyond which you would probably experience pretty severe attentional deficits.", "I mean, you give a young child,\neven an infant, an iPad, I mean, that kid is in the tunnel.\n\nI don't necessarily\nthink that's a bad thing.\n\nAnd computers and computer screens\nare going to be a part of their lives now and forever, presumably.\n\nBut it is the case that there are a lot\nof people who perhaps have the propensity for a strong generative drive, but\nbecause they also have a propensity for a pleasure drive, they wake up, they pick\nup the phone, they look at the phone, something captivates their attention,\nthen they're thinking about that.\n\nIt might be something that brings\nthem delight, but more often than not, it's something that brings\nthem either mild irritation or mild entertainment, maybe even intense\nentertainment for a short while.\n\nBut very quickly, minutes and hours go by\nin which we are not engaging in the world unless we are posting valuable content.\n\nAnd so social media is a bit\nof a drain on these drives.\n\nI mean, it taps into these\ndrives in very strong ways.\n\nAnd all one has to do is observe\nthe behavior of people in public spaces, now, in airports, on\ntrains, even in their cars.\n\nAnd people are essentially\nwatching TV all day long.", "so yes there is some evidence that overall phones and smartphones have increased risk behavior but it's more the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "but there's clear evidence about viewing pornography around just not having goodal healthy sexual relationships because porn is not normal it is it is not a normal relationship between two people what you are doing is really making it so that way you um you're you're not necessarily developing a healthy relationship with your partner because you're assuming some gold standard out there that may or may not be able to be achieved so um and it also is also a problem with body shaming and the body types that most people don't have and can't achieve and that's that that's another problem out there with with uh with with pornography a lot of questions about how social media impacts brain development that's probably an entire episode unto itself it is it is that that we could do another time and we should and um if you'd be so gracious to come back and do that we we will um I think as a just a final question you know is there any um information about potential causality between the Mental Health crisis that we observe in Youth and um let's just say substance use um of the sorts that we talked about today obviously the directionality is tricky there you can imagine that a lot of HGC cannabis use is leading to more psychosis but seems more likely that um kids are self-medicating correct in the face of like immense challenge you know not just the lockdowns and the culture around isolating kids from other kids and um the stress that was on everybody um stress generally the sociopolitical landscape social media I mean it's hard to not feel like it's at least a cloudier maybe a darker time than it used to be but I don't know I mean we humans have evolved through a lot um and it I don't know that it's also fair to say that everyone's you know bummed out about what they see presumably there's still some optimists out there so absolutely uh there there plenty of studies that show the bidirectional relationship between anxiety depression Mental Health and substance use you're right a lot of teens are self-medicating by using various substances to reduce their anxiety reduce their stress and also just social lubrication right of going into a party and and pregaming or going into a party and using drugs to make themselves uh less stiff less less stressed during that situation but more what we're talking about is that they're self-medicating because they're feeling sad or uncomfortable and this is they think helping them again it's not helping it's making them feel less bad had by continuing to use", "Now, the smartphone is\na very interesting tool for dopamine in light of all this.\n\nIt's extremely common\nnowadays to see people texting and doing selfies and\ncommunicating in various ways, listening to podcasts, listening to music, doing all sorts of\nthings while they engage in other activities or going to dinner and texting other people or making plans, sharing information.\n\nThat's all wonderful, it gives depth and\nrichness and color to life, but it isn't just about\nour distracted nature when we're engaging with the phone, it's also a way of layering in dopamine.\n\nAnd it's no surprise\nthat levels of depression and lack of motivation are\nreally on the increase.\n\nEverything that we've\ntalked about until now sets up an explanation or interpretation of why interacting with digital technology can potentially lead to disruptions or lowering in baseline\nlevels of dopamine.", "but you're trying to understand their experience is important also so you can help them understand what is not acceptable for them to experience on social media if they're being harassed or bullied by strangers uh that is a problem you want your child to to tell you about that to report that um if they see something posted online that's really concerning to them let's say they see a friend post that they're thinking of taking their own life or harming themsel in another way you want them to know that that's important to flag and to get help you know that they shouldn't just you know scroll past that so that conversation is really important and finally as parents we can lead by example right and this is hard because the truth is we've been talking about social media and youth and that's what the subject of my search and General's advisory was on but I have concerns about adults too I said as somebody who's had challenges in my own use you know of social media finding sometimes it bleeds you know past my bedtime and I'm realized you know I think m&a checked something for 5 minutes an hour later I'm still there you know scrolling through something uh and sometimes I you know you know I find myself over the years I found myself comparing myself also to posts I see online and unhealthy ways sometimes I find myself um sort of pulled into uh content uh that uh you know ends up being angry and vitriolic and leaves me feeling worse you know at the end", "and I'm not calling them adaptive or maladaptive they're clearly here to stay they've assisted in medicine I'm sure it makes it easier for doctors to communicate on the on the ward and and for um clinic and it's so useful right but contained in the small device um there are things like uh for instance text messaging where unlike 20 years ago we can have four or five different conversations very quickly while boarding a flight um there's a task switching element that was just not present in our life um prior to that um social media in particular this notion of being able to scroll so move if we really step back from this move one's thumb and access hundreds if not thousands of video content from dist which Each of which has a distinct context um and so I have to imagine that kids and adults have frontal coures that are learning these rules and the rule rule is move your thumbs stay engaged emotions either positive veence emotions or negative emotions I mean it's it's a fairly limited um landscape there when you really think about it"]

Ground Truths: ["Youth's compulsive digital habits often lead to feelings of loneliness and anxiety, as they engage in activities like video games and social media out of compulsion rather than genuine enjoyment. This compulsive engagement can result in a lack of awareness about their emotional state, as they may not realize they are not feeling good. Instead of providing satisfaction, these habits can create a sense of pain and desperation, particularly in the context of addiction to online content."]

Answer: 

Neural circuits play a significant role in the behaviors and interactions related to anxiety and depression in boys, though the information provided is not exclusively focused on boys. In general, these circuits involve connections between several key brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, dopamine centers, and the amygdala.

During puberty and adolescence, there's increased connectivity between these areas, which are involved in motivation, decision-making, reward processing, and emotional regulation. This heightened integration allows for testing of circuits related to emotions and rewards as they pertain to decision-making. As a result, adolescents, including boys, may engage in more risk-taking behaviors and experience intense emotional states.

For boys specifically, the neural circuits related to sex and violence are particularly heightened. These circuits have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years and can contribute to extreme behaviors and interactions. This heightened activity in these circuits may play a role in how boys experience and express anxiety and depression.

In the context of mental health issues like anxiety and depression, the fear-related neurons in these circuits can trigger autonomic arousal and stress responses. When activated, these neurons can cause physical symptoms such as pupil dilation, increased heart rate, and the release of stress hormones into the bloodstream. These physiological responses can contribute to the experience of anxiety in boys.

It's important to note that while these neural circuits are present in both boys and girls, their expression and impact may differ. Boys tend to have higher suicide rates and often use more violent means when attempting suicide, which may be related to the heightened activity in circuits associated with aggression and impulsivity.

However, the information provided doesn't offer a complete picture of how these neural circuits specifically affect anxiety and depression in boys as opposed to girls. More research focused on gender differences in these neural circuits and their relationship to anxiety and depression would be needed to provide a more comprehensive answer.

lot of changes and\nthickness of the brain at different stages, et cetera.\n\nBut I think most people will be interested in what that translates\nto in the real world.\n\nAnd what's interesting is during puberty, there's increased connection, connectivity as we call it\nbetween the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in\nmotivation and decision-making, being able to suppress action for making long-term goals possible, as well as dopamine\ncenters and the amygdala.\n\nSo there's this really broad\nintegration and testing.\n\nI think this is the key element here, testing of circuits\nfor emotions and reward as they relate to decisions.\n\nAnd I think that's useful because when you look at the behavior\nof adolescents and teens, they are testing social interactions, they are testing physical\ninteractions with the world.\n\nOftentimes they're engaging\nin unsafe behavior.\n\nI would never try and justify that with the underlying neurology, but the neuroscience points\nto increased connectivity between areas of the brain that\nare related to emotionality and to threat detection like\nthe amygdala, but also reward.\n\nSo it's a time of testing behaviorally how different behaviors\nlead to success or not.\n\nIt's how different behaviors\nlead to fear states or not.", "- Right, that is a central question.\n\nI can say, at least with\nrespect to the fear neurons that sit on top of the aggression neurons, we know that when those neurons are activated optogenetically, in the same way we would\nactivate the aggression neurons, that there's clearly an arousal\nprocess that's occurring, you can see the pupils\ndilate in the animal.\n\nThere is an increase in stress hormone release\ninto the bloodstream, we've shown that heart rate goes up.\n\nSo in addition to the\ndrive to actually freeze, which is what those animals do, there is autonomic arousal and neuroendocrine activation\nof stress responses.\n\nAnd some of that is probably shared by the aggression neurons\nand the mating neurons, although we haven't investigated\nit in as much detail, but I wouldn't be surprised because they project to\nmany of the same regions that the fear neurons project to, which is a interesting issue in the context to discuss later maybe, in the context of why we're comfortable with mental illnesses that are based on maladaptations of fear,\nbut not mental illnesses

more boys die from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or

depressive states, but mainly the manic\nstates of bipolar disorder.\n\nWe already discussed the\nfact that interception, registering of one's own internal emotions and bodily states is diminished in people with bipolar disorder.\n\nBut we haven't really talked\nabout the neural circuits that are responsible for\nthat lack of recognition.\n\nFor that reason, I'd like\nto point out a paper.\n\nThis is a fairly recent paper,\njust came out this year, but it's an excellent one, Looking at the changes over\ntime in neural circuitry in people with high genetic\nrisk for bipolar disorder, and in particular in young people.\n\nAnd studies of this sort are rare, but are exceedingly\nimportant because of the fact that they track individuals over time.\n\nThe title of this paper is, Longitudinal Changes in\nStructural Connectivity in Young People at High Genetic\nRisk for Bipolar Disorder.\n\nWe will provide a link to this study in the show note captions.", "These circuits that we're\ncalling pro-social circuits light up in the brain in neuroimaging, meaning the neurons are\nfiring more actively, more electrically robustly; sort of like turning up the volume on these neural circuits in the

quaking of the voice, all of the things are associated\nwith defensive behaviors are actually antagonized,\nmeaning they are reduced when the pro-social\ncircuits are more active.\n\nSo the framework here that I'd like to set is that we have this kind of seesaw of neural circuits in the brain.\n\nOne set that are\npro-social and are designed to bring us closer to\nothers, including ourselves, closer to certain sensory\nexperiences, right?\n\nBecause a lot of pro-social behaviors can also be geared towards\nthings like pets or food, or anything that we find\nwe want to be closer to and want

longer satisfying.\n\nHaving sex is no longer that much fun,\nwhich is a component of depression.\n\nIf there's a mechanism in the brain\nthat tells you something is rewarding, by definition, that's not functioning\nnormally in severe depression.\n\nSo we were doing models of\ndepression to figure out how the dopamine reward circuitry was\nchanging, as were many other labs.\n\nWe were studying addiction.\n\nThose were the obvious ones.\n\nAnd, I mean, it might be entertaining\nto your audience to learn how academic scientists think.\n\nI was thinking, those\nare fascinating topics.\n\nThey're pretty competitive.\n\nLots of other labs were working on it.\n\nAnd I started thinking what\nother experiences might be modifying the reward circuitry.\n\nI actually made some

not the premier, then certainly among the\ntop three premier journals in the field of science about the biology of\nadolescence and puberty, as well as some of the\ncore needs and demands that have to be met for successful emotional\nmaturation during that time.\n\nWe will provide a link to that, but I just want to highlight a few of the things that they\nplace in the final table.\n\nI don't want to go through\nall the results right now, because you could do that\non your own if you like.\n\nThey mainly highlight a lot of the changes in\nneurons and neural circuits.\n\nFor instance, I'll just highlight one, there's a connection between the dopamine centers in the brain and an area of the brain that's involved in emotion and dispersal.\n\nDispersal is very interesting.", "Now, that's a very broad statement, but we know for instance, in epilepsy, that GABA levels are reduced and therefore you get runaway excitation of certain circuits in the brain, and therefore seizures, either petite mal, mini seizures, or grand\nmal, massive seizures, or even drop seizures where\npeople completely collapse to the floor in seizure.\n\nYou may have seen this before.\n\nI certainly have, it's very dramatic and it actually is quite\ndebilitating for people because obviously they don't\nknow when these seizures are coming on most often, and then they can fall into a stove\nor while driving, et cetera.\n\nSo the situation with OCD is one in which, for whatever reason, we don't\nknow the direction of effect.\n\nCertain hormones are elevated in females and certain hormones are elevated in males and those hormones differ\nbetween males and females, and yet they both funnel into a system where GABAergic or GABA\ntransmission in the brain is reduced because of this ability for those particular hormones to be antagonists to GABA, and as a consequence, there's\nlikely to be overall levels of increased excitation in\ncertain networks in the brain and that brings us back to this cortico-striatal-thalamic loop, this repetitive loop\nthat seems to reinforce, we can say reinforces\nobsession, leads to anxiety, leads to compulsion, leads to\ntransient relief of anxiety, but then increase in anxiety,\nincreased obsession, anxiety, compulsion, anxiety,\ncompulsion, anxiety, compulsion, and so on and so forth."]

Ground Truths: ['The context discusses neural circuits related to sex and violence, which have evolved over a long period and are heightened in boys. However, it suggests that the underlying issues related to anxiety and depression are not being addressed, as the behaviors and interactions are happening faster and with more severe consequences. This implies that while neural circuits may influence behaviors, the deeper issues related to anxiety and depression are not being effectively managed or understood.']

Answer: 

Independence and free play are crucial for children's development, serving multiple important functions that shape their cognitive, social, and emotional growth.

Unstructured playtime is essential for children to learn vital life skills. During free play, children have the opportunity to negotiate situations with peers, resolve conflicts, and recognize social cues. These experiences help them develop crucial abilities like collaboration and emotional intelligence, which are fundamental for their future interactions and relationships.

Play also allows children to explore different roles and contingencies in a low-stakes environment. This exploration is critical for understanding social hierarchies, leadership, and group dynamics. Through role-play and other forms of imaginative play, children can safely experiment with various social positions and behaviors, helping them develop a sense of self and their place in the world.

The independence afforded by free play is particularly significant for brain development. As children engage in self-directed play, they strengthen neural connections related to decision-making, problem-solving, and creativity. This process of neural pruning and strengthening during play is fundamental in shaping who they become as adults, influencing their behaviors, emotions, and thought patterns.

Moreover, independent play fosters a sense of autonomy and self-reliance in children. When given the freedom to explore and make choices during play, children learn to trust their instincts, develop confidence in their abilities, and become more comfortable with independence. This self-directed learning is invaluable for their overall development and future success.

It's worth noting that the current trend of reduced unstructured playtime for children, partly due to increased screen time and more structured activities, may be impacting their mental health and development. Encouraging more opportunities for independent, free play could be beneficial in counteracting these effects and promoting healthier child development.

they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike

to have\nthings delivered to us, to the point where we are toddlers and we can access things in the world, but we tend to assume\nthat they are all ours.\n\nAnd then the next stage is the really key stage\nas it relates to play because is in the next\nstage of development is where young children start to interact with other children and there\'s an exchange and a possession and then a letting go of certain things, learning that not everything is yours and that the entire world is not about you is one of the key contingencies that is established during play.\n\nIt\'s one of the key way\nin which children go from being very self-centered and basically unable to\nengage with other kids for very long, without some sort of eruption of crying and some sort of battle of, you know, kind of push pull over an object to things like sharing and\nthings like cooperative play.', "So we establish that play is homeostatic, meaning we all need to do it.\n\nMany of us, including myself, haven't played that much as adults.\n\nWe're all pretty busy.\n\nNumber of us are stressed.\n\nWe got a lot to do in life, but as children, most all of us engage in a lot of play.\n\nAnd in looking at the way\nthat very young children and especially toddlers play, we can learn a lot because it reveals the fundamental rules by which the toddler brain\ninteracts with the world.", "So we can look at this\nstage of development, we call childhood and we can look at each stage\nof it and we can say, wow, there are all these\ndifferent dimensions of play that really are about testing out how we feel comfortable or uncomfortable, how we react good or bad, how we react with stress or with glee when others behave in certain ways.\n\nAnd so what I'm hoping is coming through is that play is not just about having fun.\n\nPlay is about testing.\n\nIt's about experimenting and it's about expanding\nyour brain's capacity.\n\nAnd that's through early in development, and it's through throughout the lifespan.\n\nSo at this point in the discussion, I want to take a step back, look at the biology and\nneurochemistry of play just a little bit.\n\nAnd that really define\nwhat is effective play.\n\nIf the goal of play is to\nexplore different contingencies in low stakes environments and to expand the function\nof our prefrontal cortex so that we can see new possibilities and new ways of being become\nmore flexible, more creative, more effective outside\nof the games of play or the arenas of play, I should say.", 'So as we transition from forms of play that are all about the self that are all me, me, me, me, "The Toddlers Creed" to forms of play that involve some discomfort in assuming roles that maybe we don\'t want and\nnot getting what we want.\n\nIt\'s really an opportunity for the brain to start to explore different\nroles that people take, how they work as individuals and as pairs and in larger groups.\n\nAnd to do that in a low\nstakes environment, right?\n\nYou wouldn\'t want this to be worked out on the battlefield or\nwhen searching for food or in some high stakes environment where the survival of the\nspecies was important.\n\nIt appears that these\ncircuitry for

can be explored in\na low stakes environment.', "Indeed that's what happens when children play when adolescents play and when young adults play, whether or not it's social play or play with an object, whether or not it's a\nsport or a play of any kind imaginary play imaginary friend play, there is a strengthening of\ncertain neural connections and a pruning away of up to 40%, perhaps even more of connections that are not necessary for\ncertain types of behaviors, emotions, and thoughts.\n\nAnd what this means is that it is through the process of play, that we become who we are as adults.\n\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, it is through the process of play that we are able to adjust\nwho we are as adults.\n\nNow, there are bounds on this process, as far as I know there's\nnever been a reported case of an individual who had a hyperplastic or I should say a brain that\nwas as plastic in adulthood as it was in childhood.\n\nBut what this tells us is that what we do in the process\nof play as children is really how we set up the rules for how we behave as adults\nin almost all domains, which is really incredible.", "The number of questions\ngoes on and on and on.\n\nAnd I will provide a link to a paper that asks a number of questions that helps you arrive at\na sort of score of sorts or an index of what Güneş\nand others have referred to as personal play identity.\n\nThe point is that if we look back to our early adolescence, somewhere between 10 and 14 years old, a peak time for social development, a peak time for play of various kinds, a peak time for motor development, a peak time of psychosocial development, where we learn where we\nfit into hierarchies.\n\nAs we relate to members of the same sex of the opposite sex, et cetera, we can start to get a portal into how and why we show up to\nvarious activities in work and relationship, et cetera, as adults.\n\nIn fact, I'll venture to say that\nif we go into that process for ourselves for five or 10 minutes, you start to see some remarkable parallels between the way you were at that stage and your tendencies and\nyour preferences as adults.", "One of my favorite things\nabout developmental biology and developmental psychology is that it is grounded in the fact that we don't just have a\nchildhood and an adulthood.\n\nThere isn't just our child\nself and our adult self.\n\nAnd even though there\nare transitions around the mechanisms that\nunderline neuroplasticity at approximately age 25, it is simply the case that development is our entire lifespan, that our lifespan is one\nlong developmental arc.\n\nHow long depends on our\ngenetics, our lifestyle accidents, injury and disease of course, but it is one long developmental arc.\n\nAnd so it shouldn't surprise us at all that how we learn to play as\na 10 year old or 12 year old would impact how we play\nand interact with people as a teenager and a young adult and on and on and on.\n\nAnd that play is the\nplace in which we explore in which we learn play is the substrate by which our nervous system changes us from this hyper-connected\nbatch of neurons, where everything is\nconnected to everything, more or less to a brain and nervous system whereby certain circuits work\nwith immense proficiency and others are less accessible to us.", 'Now you can look at your adult, counterparts, and indeed we should probably\nlook at ourselves and ask, you know did we learn\nproper play contingency when we were younger?\n\nDo we tend to take things too seriously?\n\nDo we tend to overreact aggressively when other people are clearly engaging in, you know, playful, jabbing or sarcasm or things of that sort.\n\nSo each of you will have a\ndifferent experience of this, but the point is that play\nserves many functions, it\'s not just about the self.\n\nIt\'s also about interactions\nbetween multiple people.\n\nIt\'s about rule testing and low stakes contingency rule breaking also\nserves an important role as is with the example\nof the "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting other puppies et cetera.\n\nAnd last but not least, there are different forms of play that help us establish who\nwe will become as adults.\n\nOne of the more powerful of these is role play when children\nand sometimes adults will take on different\nroles that are distinct from their natural world roles in order to for instance,\nestablish hierarchies.\n\nSo someone\'s going to be the leader and someone\'s going to be the follower.\n\nSomeone will be dominant.\n\nSomeone will be submissive.\n\nSomeone will work alone.\n\nOther people will work in a group.']

Ground Truths: ["Independence and free play are significant in children's development as they help restore a fun and adventurous childhood, allowing children to create memories through real-world experiences. These experiences foster independence and adventure, enabling children to work out conflicts themselves rather than relying on virtual adventures."]

Answer: 

The potential risks associated with social media exposure for young people are numerous and concerning. These risks can be broadly categorized into mental health, physical health, and social development issues.

Mental health risks are particularly prominent. Nearly half of adolescents report that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image, as they constantly compare themselves to others online. This issue affects both girls and boys. Moreover, adolescents who use social media for 3 hours or more per day double their risk of experiencing anxiety or depression symptoms. Given that the average use is 3.5 hours per day, this puts a majority of young people at risk.

Physical health is also impacted. About a third of adolescents report staying up until midnight or later on weeknights using their devices, with much of this time spent on social media. This reduction in sleep can significantly affect their overall well-being and development.

Social development risks include exposure to harmful content, harassment, and bullying. Alarmingly, six out of ten adolescent girls report being approached by strangers on social media in ways that made them feel uncomfortable. There's also concern about how social media use may be replacing in-person interactions and physical activities, potentially affecting social skill development.

The erosion of self-esteem is another significant risk. Social media can create pressure for young people to present a curated, inauthentic version of themselves online, rather than feeling confident in their true selves.

Time spent on social media is substantial, with young people in America spending about five hours a day just on these platforms. This extensive use can detract from other important activities and experiences crucial for healthy development.

It's important to note that while there are some benefits to social media use, such as self-expression and finding support from like-minded individuals, these benefits don't necessarily outweigh the potential harms.

While this information provides a comprehensive overview of the risks, it's worth noting that more research may be needed to fully understand the long-term impacts of social media use on young people's social and physical development.

you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", "oh if you're being contacted by strange men around the world who want to have sex with you like that's not good for 11 12 year old girls so it's all these different potential harms and then imagine all these different potential effects S one of which is depression and another is anxiety another is self harm but there's doing worse in school there's becoming more shallow there's uh conflicts with your so there's a whole bunch and then we want to look at the causal connections and what I'm trying to draw out is suppose you we suppose we could quantify the degree to which sheer time just spending five hours a day does that make you more anxious automatically well maybe a little um but that's probably not the main effect so there's a gigantic multicausal network of effects now um I have good numbers for how much the how much teenss are using these devices and these platforms today um Pew in particular did has done a great job of of tracking changes in this since the ear since the 2000s what we know today from both Pew and Gallup is that young people in America are now spending about five hours a day just on social media just social media", "so yes there is some evidence that overall phones and smartphones have increased risk behavior but it's more the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "but you're trying to understand their experience is important also so you can help them understand what is not acceptable for them to experience on social media if they're being harassed or bullied by strangers uh that is a problem you want your child to to tell you about that to report that um if they see something posted online that's really concerning to them let's say they see a friend post that they're thinking of taking their own life or harming themsel in another way you want them to know that that's important to flag and to get help you know that they shouldn't just you know scroll past that so that conversation is really important and finally as parents we can lead by example right and this is hard because the truth is we've been talking about social media and youth and that's what the subject of my search and General's advisory was on but I have concerns about adults too I said as somebody who's had challenges in my own use you know of social media finding sometimes it bleeds you know past my bedtime and I'm realized you know I think m&a checked something for 5 minutes an hour later I'm still there you know scrolling through something uh and sometimes I you know you know I find myself over the years I found myself comparing myself also to posts I see online and unhealthy ways sometimes I find myself um sort of pulled into uh content uh that uh you know ends up being angry and vitriolic and leaves me feeling worse you know at the end", "There are ways that\nit can be negative, in terms of bad interactions,\nthings like bullying, which we can talk about because\nthere's a lot that we've done to basically make sure that\npeople can be safe from that and give people tools and\ngive kids the ability to have the right parental controls.\n\nTheir parents can oversee that.\n\nBut that's the interacting\nwith people side.", "as our brain and bodies mature we have more autonomy in where we take them but that means also more exposure to the ideas suggestions actions pure pressure of others and um that's sometimes where the the problems arise and who knows probably also where the solutions come from too from time to time but I think as conscientious people um who mind the well-being of others of our species we'd all like to know sort of like what are the key features that Mark this stage of development maybe we'll just start off by talking about this through the lens of um your expertise as a developmental psychologist you know what is adolescence in the teen years like what's going on um what sorts of things are being worked out psychologically um that we might not be aware of and then we can talk about some of the common pitfalls and the risk-taking Behavior everything from smoking vaping drug use um sexual behavior uh addictive behaviors as it relates to social media bullying risky driving there's so much there", "People who treat teens often talk about\nthis, that you see something that you didn't often see before, where a person\nwho might have gotten through a lot of formative years thinking like, oh,\nhow I look is okay, for example, then is bombarding themselves with social\nmedia that tells them how they look is not okay, and then that changes."]

Ground Truths: ['The potential risks associated with social media exposure for young people include exposure to harmful content such as child predators and pornography. Additionally, excessive screen time can lead to physical issues like nearsightedness (myopia), as indicated by the observation that spending two hours outside can help offset this condition.']

Answer: 

Gambling addiction can have severe psychological effects on individuals, as discussed in several Huberman Lab podcast episodes. One of the most significant impacts is the persistent belief that the next gamble could change everything. This creates a cycle of hope and disappointment that can be particularly damaging to the addict's mental state.

The addiction often leads to a progressive narrowing of the things that bring pleasure in life. Gambling addicts may lose interest in other activities, relationships, and personal well-being as they become increasingly focused on gambling. This narrowing of interests can result in social isolation and a deterioration of overall life satisfaction.

The compulsive nature of gambling addiction can cause individuals to feel bad when they're not engaging in the activity. This discomfort drives them to seek out gambling opportunities, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of addiction. The temporary relief or excitement gained from gambling provides a form of self-medication for underlying feelings of loneliness or anxiety.

Gambling addiction can also lead to severe financial consequences, which in turn cause psychological distress. Addicts may experience shame, guilt, and anxiety related to spending family money or accumulating debt. These negative emotions can further fuel the addiction as the individual seeks escape through more gambling.

In some cases, gambling addiction can escalate to the point where it causes depression. As the addiction progresses, even gambling itself may cease to provide the same level of dopamine release or satisfaction, leaving the individual in a state of emotional emptiness.

It's important to note that breaking a gambling addiction can be particularly challenging. Unlike substance addictions where complete abstinence is possible, gambling addicts must learn to manage their behavior while still engaging with money in their daily lives, which can be likened to asking an alcoholic to drink moderately.

The psychological effects of gambling addiction are complex and can have far-reaching impacts on an individual's mental health, relationships, and overall quality of life.

and then work our way towards more typical circumstances and with that said addiction unfortunately is very common nowadays I just heard a statistic in fact that there is an 8080 percent increase in alcohol use disorder among women in the last 30 years I talked a little bit about this in the episode that I did about alcohol and health again I want to be very clear I'm not somebody that is completely against alcohol for adults provided they're not alcoholics turns out two drinks a week probably fine health-wise zero would be better if we're honest zero is better than any alcohol but two drinks a week is probably fine past two drinks you start running into problems and yet many many people out there male and female alike suffer from alcohol use disorder also called alcoholism the same is also true for things like methamphetamine or cocaine or other types of substance addictions and the same is also true for a lot of Behavioral or what are sometimes called process addictions things like sex addiction or video game addiction or any type of behavior that frankly is leveraging the dopamine system but that engages this Progressive narrowing of the things that bring someone pleasure such that nothing else is really Salient nothing else is really pulling them in in the way that they're video games or sex or pornography or alcohol pick your substance or you know behavior that you

Answer: 

Involving Child Protective Services (CPS) when a child is seen playing outside alone can have several serious consequences:

1. Legal implications: In some states, allowing a child to play outside unsupervised can be interpreted as evidence of child neglect. This ambiguity in laws has led to situations where parents face legal scrutiny for what was once considered normal childhood behavior.

2. Family disruption: Once CPS becomes involved, families can face significant disruptions. This may include custody battles and increased supervision, potentially limiting parents' ability to be alone with their children.

3. Overreaction to normal activities: The context mentions incidents where police were called because an 8-year-old was seen unaccompanied, highlighting how society's perception of childhood independence has changed dramatically since the 1990s.

4. Incentivizing overprotective parenting: The threat of CPS involvement can lead parents to become overly cautious, potentially limiting their children's independence and opportunities for unstructured play.

5. Long-term impact on child development: By discouraging independent outdoor play, children may miss out on important developmental experiences that contribute to their overall well-being and growth.

It's worth noting that efforts are being made to address these issues. For example, eight states have passed laws stating that allowing a child to play independently cannot be taken as evidence of child neglect. These legislative changes aim to restore a more balanced approach to childhood independence and reduce unnecessary CPS interventions.

However, it's important to recognize that the fear of child abduction, while statistically rare, has contributed to the current climate of heightened concern. According to FBI statistics mentioned in the context, there are only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings per year in the entire country, most often involving family members in custody disputes.

The unintended consequence of overprotection has been a significant increase in mental health issues among children, including a spike in suicide rates. This suggests that the societal response to perceived dangers may be causing more harm than the rare occurrences it aims to prevent.

the exas generation the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "whatever but um but kids need to be out playing with each other especially Outdoors we evolved in savanas we evolved in different parts of the world we're attracted to Nature um so that's the way it it always was now uh especially if we in the 1950s and 60s America just been through a World War and the greatest way to make people trust each other the greatest way to boost social capital is a foreign attack and of course Pearl Harbor did more for American Co coherence than anything else in history in modern history 911 did that too but only for a little while and then we we lost it um so for a a lot of reasons people trusted their neighbors kids were out playing you know my parents grew up in the depression in New York City the kids were all out playing stickball on the street or in a parking lot in the 1970s there is a real crime wave um crime goes through the roof actually and it goes through the 80s that goes all the way to the early 90s even still you were kicked out of the house to go play um even in New York City all kids went out to play that's just the way it was but we begin to lose trust in each other for a lot of reasons Robert putam wrote about this in Bowling alone the the the the loss of Social Capital many reasons for that the changing media environment air conditioning and television people are not hanging out on their porch in the summertime to get away from the Heat they Clos the door and they put on the AC and they watch TV family sizes are shrinking there are not that many kids around so for a lot of reasons by the the 90s is the key decade where act two of the tragedy happens and that's the loss of the play-based childhood", "most Instagram no so it the the huge time suck is the videos so it's actually Tik Tok and YouTube are counted in this analysis they're counted as social media YouTube is marginally social media it's more of an general information Source but the point is especially the short videos the short videos are really really addictive because the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the house every day to go play my mom would say get out of the house I now realize she wanted space yeah", "so in America and Britain we freaked out about child abduction and child sexual abuse um some of the scandals were real the Boy Scouts the Catholic Church there were cases where trusted organizations were covering up abuse and I recall the abduction thing the carton y thing right and there was a show I think my name is Brian you know about the kid who was abducted and then all he remembered I think it's a true story was that his name was Brian he would just remind himself every night about his real name you know I think they found him eventually in Berkeley mhm not calling out Berkeley I lived in Berkeley for a long time but um seemed to be the discovery of of Abu of abducted kid excuse me in Berkeley uh there are a few other cases there I don't know what that's about um in any of I grew up thinking that you could get kidnapped right yeah which yeah which is so it's I mean it's the most terrifying possibility for any parent um but when I was doing the research for the codling the American mind I found according to FBI statistics there's only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings a year in our whole country because if a child like who would take a child like it's a really difficult crime and you're going to you know who would steal a child from a store you know parents are afraid if your kid goes to the next D on the grocery store going to be how are you going to take a kicking and screaming kid out of a store um it's and yet sorry to interrupt but the show America's Most Wanted I believe was hosted by a guy whose kid was abducted and eventually found dead exactly Adam that's right right so so there was this propagation of this fear like that one of the deepest fears of any parent I can to imagine is is is that that's right but the point is that these crimes are extraordinarily rare it's almost always the non-custodial parent who takes a kid it's a family member because there's a fight within the family um so we fear the wrong things we're terrified of kidnapping um but locking our kids up overprotecting them has spiked the suicide rate so much that the death toll is vastly higher from the extra suicides than it would be if we could completely wipe out kidnapping which again doesn't"]

Answer: 

Smartphone use has been associated with several potential harmful changes across various aspects of life. These can be broadly categorized into mental health, physical health, and social behavior impacts.

In terms of mental health, there's evidence of increased rates of depression, especially among young girls. The constant exposure to social media and the potential for negative interactions or comparisons can contribute to this. Anxiety is another concern, possibly due to the constant connectivity and pressure to respond or engage online. There's also a risk of developing attention deficits, with studies showing that even moderate smartphone use (60 minutes per day for adolescents, possibly up to 2 hours for adults) can lead to significant attentional issues.

Physical health concerns include disrupted sleep patterns, partly due to blue light exposure from screens at night. There's also a potential for decreased physical activity and time spent outdoors, as more time is devoted to smartphone use. Interestingly, some research suggests that smartphone use might negatively impact male fertility, with studies indicating a decline in sperm quality associated with mobile phone use, regardless of usage time.

Social behavior changes are notable as well. There's a trend towards less in-person interaction, with people often engaging with their phones even when physically present with others. This can lead to what's termed "solitude deprivation," where individuals rarely experience periods free from stimuli created by other human minds, potentially leading to cognitive exhaustion and increased anxiety.

Additionally, smartphones have changed how young people interact and engage in risky behaviors. While not inherently causing these behaviors, smartphones provide easier access and platforms for sharing or promoting such activities, potentially amplifying their impact.

It's important to note that research in this area is ongoing, as widespread smartphone use is a relatively recent phenomenon. While these potential harmful changes are concerning, more long-term studies are needed to fully understand the impacts of smartphone use on various aspects of human health and behavior.

over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "There are some studies\nand one in particular that I'd like to highlight one was actually carried\nout pretty early in 2014.\n\nThis is a study that\nexplored smartphone use at the time they called\nit mobile phone use, but smartphone use and inattention, difficulties in attending\nin 7,102 adolescents that's a huge study, a population based cross-sectional study and you will be probably\nsurprised and somewhat dismayed to hear that in order\nto avoid this decrease in attentional capacity, adolescents needed to use their smartphone for less than 60 minutes per day, in order to stay focused and\ncentered on their other tasks.\n\nOtherwise they started to really run into significant issues.\n\nSo 60 minutes is not much, I've a feeling that most young people are using their phone more\nthan 60 minutes per day, I know I am.\n\nI think for adults, the number's probably higher\nmeaning if you're an adult, I'm going to just extrapolate\nfrom what I read in this study.\n\nIt seems that probably two\nhours a day on the phone would be the upper limit beyond which you would probably experience pretty severe attentional deficits.", "yep there's additional blue light exposure there's just so much to it exactly so if we pull all that together for the time being and put it in a basket of smart phone use and maybe we'll we'll pull out each of those variables one by one as we go forward what are the numbers in 2012 in terms of how much time girls maybe you can give us an age range are spending with the smartphone was it they got the smartphone and immediately we're spending six to eight hours a day on the thing or has it been gradual so let's let's start with the time the time variable sure okay so first the way you put it is actually very helpful um what I want listeners to imagine let's say like imagine on the left left side of a slide I haven't made this slide I'm formulating in my head imagine on the left side of the slide a whole bunch of harmful changes if you're getting less sleep that's bad if you're having blue light at night that's bad if you're not going out in nature that's bad if you are sedentary if you so so imagine about you know 15 different things", "so I I point to that it's that 5-year period 2010 to 2015 which I've called the Great rewiring of childhood because it affects everything everything about what children and teenagers are doing I can recall in 2010 I was actually in New York City visiting friends I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting yeah nowadays I think of it less as addicting but almost um like an an OCD of sorts and here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD but the interesting thing about OCD is that the compulsions the behaviors don't serve to reduce the obsessions rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them and in many ways I feel like smartphone use and social media use in particular is a OCD of sorts it's not just habit it's not just an addiction it's an obsessive compulsive Loop so it's already a struggle to pay attention and you know ancient Traditions have have taught techniques to improve your focus your attention we're easily distracted and um you know so I don't work on my phone very much because I I hate to type on the phone and and I'm always at a computer but even for me sitting at my computer as soon as the thinking gets hard as soon as if I'm writing if I'm doing something that requires concentration some little part of my brain says I wonder what the weather's going to be and I go check the weather or you know oh did I get any email I go check my I might check my email you know probably 40 50 times a day and I know that's terrible so the question is is it a compulsion where I feel pulled I have to check it or something bad will happen no it's more like imagine trying to do your work imagine trying to be a kid in school and you have on your desk in front of you you have your television set your record player a walkie talk to talk to your friends a guitar a painting set all array in front of you and your teacher is telling you about you know geometry what are you going to do probably one of these things and so I think the smartphone where a flip phone it's it's a tool you pull it out if you want to talk to someone then you put it away but the smartphone there's no reason to ever put it away talk to us about the scary statistics there's just no way around this yeah", "but but for one of the other negative effects right so we have the positive effects you talked about which is consolidation of learning and acceleration of learning we had the one negative effect which was the pavlovian connection to distraction the other I've written about before is Solitude deprivation right so so I'm using a different definition of solitude than the colloquial one most people think of it as a physical thing I'm I'm just isolated but there's a there's a cognitive psychological definition of solitude which means absence of stimuli created by other human Minds right so I'm not taking in information that's coming directly from another human mind uh having no period with this Solitude so having no period in your day where your free from stimuli creative from other Minds is Solitude deprivation and it's a real issue and partially it's a real issue because when we're processing input from another human brain it's all hands- on Deck right I mean we're very social beings a huge portion of our brain is dedicated to this right um so it's a very cognitively expensive activity when I'm trying to understand another human's what they're saying I'm simulating their mental state I'm trying to understand like where do they fall in this sort of social hierarchy and one of my arguments was um when you spend your entire day in that state it's exhausting and anxiety producing and like until we had smartphones and ubiquitous wireless internet the idea that you could banish all Solitude from your day is laughable it's just impossible right so of course we had a lot of portions of our day where our brain was not like ramped up in gear four like the sort of social processing mode but smartphones makes it possible that you can be in that mode all day long and so like one of the things I hypothesize is some of the anxiety Rises that goes with the age of smartphones is brain exhaustion right so that's like that's another negative effect of the const we have two negative effects now for the constant stimuli and one positive effect for the absence of the constant stimula so I think we're making a case here for not always being on your device", "Look, it's very\nclear that avoiding

the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical

there's becoming more shallow there's uh conflicts with your so there's a whole bunch and then we want to look at the causal connections and what I'm trying to draw out is suppose you we suppose we could quantify the degree to which sheer time just spending five hours a day does that make you more anxious automatically well maybe a little um but that's probably not the main effect so there's a gigantic multicausal network of effects now um I have good numbers for how much the how much teenss are using these devices and these platforms today um Pew in particular did has done a great job of

Answer: 

Compulsive behavior in addiction is primarily fueled by the dopamine system and its interaction with social isolation. Dopamine plays a crucial role in addiction by driving craving, motivation, and the pursuit of rewarding experiences. In the context of addiction, there's a progressive narrowing of the things that bring pleasure, leading to a compulsive focus on the addictive substance or behavior.

When individuals experience social isolation, it triggers a unique response in the brain, particularly in the dorsal raphe nucleus. This brain region contains dopamine neurons that, when activated, induce a loneliness-like state. This activation motivates the seeking out of social connections, essentially creating a "social hunger." Paradoxically, when these neurons are inhibited, it suppresses the feeling of loneliness.

The relationship between dopamine and isolation in addiction is complex. Social isolation can increase social craving, which is mediated by dopamine release. This craving for social interaction can be so intense that it activates similar brain areas as those associated with addictive substances. In fact, when socially isolated individuals are exposed to social cues, there's an increased activation in brain areas associated with dopaminergic neurons.

Interestingly, this dopamine-driven craving for social interaction can lead to alternative behaviors if social needs aren't met. For example, socially isolated individuals might turn to food as a source of comfort, as both social interaction and food can trigger dopamine release through common neural circuits.

In the context of addiction, this interplay between dopamine and isolation can fuel compulsive behavior in several ways:

1. The addictive substance or behavior becomes the primary source of dopamine release, replacing healthy social interactions.

2. Social isolation can exacerbate the craving for the addictive substance or behavior, as the brain seeks alternative sources of dopamine.

3. The progressive narrowing of pleasure-inducing activities, characteristic of addiction, can lead to further social isolation, creating a vicious cycle.

4. The dopamine system's plasticity means that repeated exposure to addictive substances can cause powerful changes in the reward circuitry, making it increasingly difficult to find pleasure in other activities, including social interactions.

Understanding this relationship between dopamine, isolation, and compulsive behavior is crucial for developing effective addiction treatments and prevention strategies. It highlights the importance of social support and connection in recovery processes, as healthy social interactions can provide an alternative source of dopamine release and help break the cycle of addiction.

just say this you don't have to think about any of those details or names or anything let's just think about addiction because in biology and in Psychology frankly it really often pays to think about the extremes first and then work our way towards more typical circumstances and with that said addiction unfortunately is very common nowadays I just heard a statistic in fact that there is an 8080 percent increase in alcohol use disorder among women in the last 30 years I talked a little bit about this in the episode that I did about alcohol and health again I want to be very clear I'm not somebody that is completely against alcohol for adults provided they're not alcoholics turns out two drinks a week probably fine health-wise zero would be better if we're honest zero is better than any alcohol but two drinks a week is probably fine past two drinks you start running into problems and yet many many people out there male and female alike suffer from alcohol use disorder also called alcoholism the same is also true for things like methamphetamine or cocaine or other types of substance addictions and the same is also true for a lot of Behavioral or what are sometimes called process addictions things like sex addiction or video game addiction or any type of behavior that frankly is leveraging the dopamine system but that engages this Progressive narrowing of the things that bring someone pleasure such that nothing else is really Salient nothing else is really pulling them in in the way that they're video games or sex or pornography or alcohol pick your substance or you know behavior that you see out there or hopefully not but that you might suffer from an addiction too so what's happening in addiction well addiction involves dopamine among other things often the opioid system Etc", "Here's the thing, when dopamine is higher\nin your brain and body, when you've deployed it through excitement or pharmacology or otherwise, it tends to narrow your focus\nand make you seek more of it in that general theme that\nyou happen to be focused on.\n\nIt could be anything.\n\nThat's the scary thing about dopamine.\n\nWhat can you do to control\nit and to reduce it?\n\nWell, for those of you\nthat are engaging in habits that are healthy, maybe that doesn't\nrequire reducing dopamine.\n\nHow do you define\nhealthy versus unhealthy?\n\nWell, I think the simplest\nway to define addiction, at least by my mind, is that addiction is a\nprogressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure.\n\nAnd a good life is a progressive expansion of the things that bring you pleasure.\n\nA rather simple definition, and yet when we think about\nthe biology of dopamine, dopamine is not unique to one pursuit.\n\nIt's not unique to the pursuit of sex or the pursuit of warmth when you're cold or cool environments when you're too warm or food or social media, it's just a dumb molecule that puts you into this forward state of\nmass, small visual aperture, and a kind of obsessive-like nature.\n\nWhat can you do to counter that?", "And we know from Rob Malenka's\nwork, who's here at Stanford, that oxytocin, you know, is the hormone that's\ninvolved in human pair bonding and relationships and love.\n\nAnd it directly links to dopamine neurons and causes the release of dopamine.\n\nSo yes, when we connect with other humans, especially in a kind of\ntranscendent spiritual way, that's a huge dopamine hit.\n\nAnd it does replace the dopamine\nthat people get from drugs.\n\nAnd for people who have\nthis addiction temperament, they need it on a more intense level.\n\nThey're not going to be\ngenerally satisfied with kind of, you know, a sort of\nacquaintanceship, right?\n\nThey want that intensity of\nthe intimacy that you get with people when you're\ncathartically exposing, you know, warts and all.\n\nSo yes, people can get\naddicted to recovery, and good for them.\n\nGo for it, you know.\n\nAnd of course this can be disruptive for friendships and relationships, where the one person is not in recovery.\n\nLike you're going to so many meetings, you're always talking about\nrecovery, but you know what, much better than them\nbeing intoxicated, right?\n\nI mean, so although you\nmay tire of your friends talking about their meetings all the time, I'm sure you would\nrather have them do that than, you know, be in their addictions.", "A side question is, the huge question\nis, why do some people develop an addiction problem and others who\nhave used this substance just don't?\n\nAnd again, as a world class neuroscientist\nyourself, you know the answer.\n\nIt's always a complex combination of\nunderlying genetics, the environment in which they find themselves, the\nenvironment in which they grew up, and how that modified their reward circuitry.\n\nSo, to get at your question, one set\nof experiments my lab did, which other labs did, too, I don't deserve the sole\ncredit for this, is showing that drugs of abuse cause powerful plasticity\nin the neurons that make up the cells that make up the reward circuitry.\n\nAnd in fact, drugs of abuse, like\ncocaine, methamphetamine, opioids like morphine, heroin, change the synapses.\n\nThe synapses are the connections from\nother nerve cells onto dopamine neurons, onto the nerve cells and the accumbens.\n\nAnd these connections,\nthese synapses, can change.\n\nAnd drugs of abuse cause powerful\nchanges in those connections, and therefore, powerful changes in the\nactivity of the dopamine neurons and the neurons in the nucleus accumbens.\n\nAnd, in fact, the types of changes that\noccur appear to be similar to the types of changes that have evolved for good uses\nfor adaptive forms of learning and memory.\n\nSo, again, this is an example that\nthis superficially simple dopamine reward circuitry is changing all\nthe time, and it's highly plastic and can become more sensitive to\ncertain experiences, etc, etc.", "There's a key finding in the literature, the title of this paper is Dorsal Raphe Dopamine Neurons Represent the Experience of Social Isolation.\n\nThis is a paper from Kat Tye's lab, the first author is Matthews, Gillian Matthews to be specific.\n\nWhat they did is they were\nable to selectively activate the dopamine neurons in\nthe dorsal raphe nucleus.\n\nAnd when they did that, they induced a loneliness-like state.\n\nNow, how did they know it\nwas a loneliness-like state?\n\nThey knew because it motivated the seeking out of social connections.\n\nThis is the kind of social hunger that I was referring to before.\n\nWhereas when the dopamine\nneurons of the dorsal raphe are inhibited, meaning\ntheir activity is quieted that suppressed a loneliness state.\n\nSo that's a little\ncounterintuitive, right?\n\nIt's a group of neurons\nthat when activated makes you feel lonely, and when this brain area is not activated, it suppresses loneliness.\n\nBut if you think about it, that's exactly the kind of\ncircuit that you would want in order to drive social behavior.\n\nWhen you're feeling lonely, dopamine is released and\nit causes you to go out and seek social interactions.\n\nWhen this brain area has\nenough social interactions, that's sort of a figure of speech, brain areas don't have\nenough social interactions, but when enough social\ninteractions have happened, that the neurons in this brain areas shut down their production of dopamine.", "Dopamine is a neuromodulator most often associated with movement, craving, motivation and desire.\n\nAnd the neural circuits\nthat are rich with dopamine are things like the substantia nigra, the mesolimbic dopamine system, the VTA, the nucleus accumbens, et cetera.\n\nThose names don't have\nto mean anything to you.\n\nHowever, this unique\npopulation of dopamine neurons in the raphe is truly unique in that it's responsible for mediating what I've been calling social homeostasis.\n\nIt is the effector or the response that mediate social homeostasis.\n\nNow I haven't told you exactly\nwhat social homeostasis is.\n\nSocial homeostasis, just like hunger, is the process by which when\nyou lack social interaction, you start to crave it.\n\nWhat's very interesting about the fact that there are dopamine\nneurons in this raphe structure that is the effector\nfor social homeostasis, what this means is that\nwhen you are not interacting with people at a frequency or intensity, that is right for you, dopamine is released into the brain.\n\nIn most popular\nconversations about dopamine, and even in scientific circles, when you hear dopamine release, you think about reward or feeling good, because indeed many behaviors and drugs of abuse increase dopamine.\n\nThat's one of the reasons they have so much addictive potential.\n\nHowever, dopamine is not\nassociated with feeling good, it is actually the neurochemical that's responsible for movement toward things that feel good.", "well then we consider it adaptive if it's not well then considered maladaptive some people will sit down to play a video game they really like video games and as they're sitting down they will experience a five-fold increase in the rate of dopamine output from their nucleus accumbens for other people it's going to be a tenfold increase for other people like me who don't like video games very much I don't have anything against them I don't dislike them but it doesn't do much for me it might not cause any increase whatsoever it might even cause a decrease in dopamine so there's a lot of individual variability for sex it turns out to be a range so the typical range that's cited in the literature is anywhere from a four to five-fold increase in the rate of dopamine neuron firing however there are certain individuals for which that number is doubled caffeine is a little bit of a special circumstance because caffeine has the property of not just causing the release of dopamine but increasing the amount of dopamine receptors over time and there aren't a lot of excellent measurements of the amount of dopamine released as a function of caffeine intake in different populations of humans it's mostly animal studies but what we think based on the Gestalt based on the overall picture of the literature is that it's an approximate doubling of the dopamine signaling that's coming out of the VTA nucleus accumens to prefrontal Cortex when we anticipate and when we drink our coffee again I really want to be clear that for all of these things these are relative levels and they are distribution so if we were to plot them out on paper you would see that these are not bar graphs these are overlapping curves to some extent so some people are going to achieve more dopamine release or less dopamine release from one Behavior or substance however it's very clear that cocaine methamphetamine even heroin for that matter are way out on the right hand side of the curve causing enormous increases in dopamine very quickly and the other things that we described have again a distribution that is more leftward shifted on this imaginary plot that I'm creating it's a lot of individual variability however it's fascinating that dopamine is the single molecule that's causing the craving and pursuit and experience of all of these substances and behaviors and the learning of all of that craving Pursuit and actual experience is what predicts whether or not we will re-engage reuse that substance or not re-engage in a behavior or not and how frequently we will do that so that's addiction but if you understand how the height of those peaks in dopamine and the rate to reach those Peaks and the troughs that result and how long the troughs take to get back to Baseline if you understand or a little or all of that you're really in a terrific position to understand how to Leverage The dopamine system for the pursuit of healthy goals and behaviors I should mention one thing about recovery from addiction which is that the reset of all that dopamine circuitry from unhealthy to healthy often involves depending on the addiction 30 days of complete abstinence that 30 days of complete abstinence inevitably involves a lot of pain and discomfort and craving anxiety insomnia Etc that relates to the big trough in dopamine that inevitably occurs now of course there are some addictions such as severe alcohol addiction and in some cases opiate addiction that immediate and sustained abstinence cannot be used as the tool somebody really needs to work with an addiction specialist and sometimes there needs to be a tapering off of the substance for other addictions it can be quote unquote cold turkey and then of course there are other addictions particularly food and sex but sometimes even things like video games for which the desired outcome is not necessarily to eliminate the behavior completely but to set some constraints around the behavior so that it's not occurring to the exclusion of other pleasureful things in life and adaptive things in life and for that there is the requirement for what are called binding behaviors we'll get back to binding behaviors later but binding behaviors or behaviors in which people bind their behavior around a particular substance use or around a particular behavioral addiction like sex Video Games Etc in space and or time in space meaning they might only engage in those particular behaviors in certain places and certain times when it's context appropriate there are numerous examples of binding behaviors in space and time it all has to do with clamping or directing when the engagement with the dopamine releasing behavior is going to occur so what's happening when people decide to go cold turkey or they use these binding behaviors well what's happening is that people are engaging the specific circuitry within the prefrontal cortex that as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode are important for context setting so in the cases of binding behaviors the prefrontal cortex is essentially getting trained up to understand that okay certain things like food or perhaps sex or perhaps video games they're okay if they are done or consumed in appropriate amounts or in particular context that requires the context setting goal directed behavior that the prefrontal cortex is responsible", 'But thought of from the different side, you could also imagine how well, if you\'re getting\na social interaction with somebody on a daily or weekly basis, and suddenly you remove that interaction, well, then people might not care, they might just think, well, I\'ll get the interaction tomorrow or the next day or the next day, because they\'re sated, much in the same way that the person who eats very regularly might say, "Well, I ate four hours ago, and I\'ll eat eight hours\nlater, no big deal."\n\nBut that\'s not what happens.\n\nThere\'s a prediction\nthat we are going to have certain types of interactions, and when those interactions don\'t happen, we replace that lack of\ninteraction with a drive and a motivation to seek\nout social interaction.\n\nAnd that drive and\nmotivation is caused by, or I should say, is driven by dopamine release\nfrom that dorsal raphe.\n\nAnd so the takeaway is that\nwhen we lack social interaction that we expect, we become pro-social.\n\nHowever, if we are\nchronically socially isolated, meaning we don\'t have interactions with people for a long time, we become actually more introverted.', "Andrew Huberman: What I'm asking here,\nqueuing up in the back of your mind, is whether or not addiction is just\nrelated to the sensation that we have when we indulge in a behavior, or\nwhen we are under the influence of a drug, or whether or not it actually\nmodifies neural circuitry in a way that makes a broader range of drugs\nor experiences attractive to us.", "It's actually very interesting, it has everything to do with whether or not they were formerly\naddicted to something else but in any case, the\nway that addiction works and the way that\nmotivation works generally in the non-addictive setting is that when you anticipate something a little bit of dopamine\nis released, and then when you reach that thing,\nyou're engaged in that thing the amount of dopamine\ngoes up even further but as you repeatedly pursue a behavior and you repeatedly engage\nwith a particular thing let's say you love running or you love chocolate as\nyou eat a piece of chocolate believe it or not, it tastes good and then there's a shift away\nfrom activation of dopamine.\n\nAnd there are other\nchemicals that are released that trigger a low level sense of pain.\n\nNow you might not feel it as physical pain but the craving that you feel is both one part dopamine and one part, the mirror image of dopamine which is the pain or the craving for yet\nanother piece of chocolate.\n\nAnd this is a very important and subtle feature of the dopamine system.\n\nThat's not often discussed.", "Andrew Huberman: Yeah, the way\nyou described it is exactly right.\n\nThose programs are highly reinforcing for\nabstinence behaviors, everything from the social connection, which we're going to\nget to social connection, as you know, to the way that people start to conceptualize\ntheir addict self versus other self.\n\nIt actually involves a splitting\nof the self in interesting ways.\n\nAs long as we're talking about\ndonuts, cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine.\n\nI'm curious, before we move to a bit\nmore on neuroplasticity, is there anything that people ought to know about\nhow different substances and behaviors that are addicting might impact the\ndopamine reward circuitry differently?\n\nSo, for instance, we talked about\ncocaine as having this very rapid onset, big increase in dopamine, then\na crash, as we know, a certain pattern of kinetics, as you describe it, the\nopioid crisis is incredibly serious problem right now, as is methamphetamine.\n\nBut it sounds like methamphetamine\nfunctions a bit like cocaine.\n\nAnd in terms of its kinetics, yes.\n\nSo an opioid is a very different\nchemical than cocaine, but it sounds like it impacts the dopamine system.\n\nIs the dopaminergic activity caused\nby opioids responsible for the addictive properties of opioids?\n\nOr do people also like the\nfeeling of being under opioids?"]

Ground Truths: ['Compulsive behavior in addiction is fueled by dopamine overshoot, where individuals feel bad when not engaging in the addictive activity. This leads to compulsive use, similar to gambling addiction, where the individual believes that the next engagement could change everything, causing motivated reasoning and dashed hopefulness. Additionally, as social lives move onto video games, porn, and social media, loneliness and anxiety increase, leading to a search for cheap and easy stimulation that ultimately is not satisfying.']

Answer: 

Real-world adventures play a crucial role in boosting kids' independence and creating lasting memories. These experiences provide children with opportunities for unstructured play time, which is essential for their mental health and development.

When children engage in real-world adventures, they learn valuable skills that contribute to their independence. For instance, they discover how to negotiate situations with other kids, resolve conflicts, and collaborate. These interactions help them recognize social cues and develop emotional intelligence, which are critical for building independence.

Adventures in the real world also create powerful, lasting memories. As Dr. Jonathan Haidt points out, exciting and sometimes scary things happen during these experiences, leading to memorable moments that children carry with them into adulthood. These memories often become shared experiences that friends continue to discuss years later.

Importantly, real-world adventures offer a level of excitement and thrills that virtual experiences simply cannot match. While digital activities like video games may seem engaging, they don't provide the same depth of experience or opportunity for personal growth. As Haidt notes, "the virtual adventures are just not going to cut it."

To foster these beneficial experiences, parents and communities can take several approaches:

1. Encourage unstructured play time outdoors, allowing children to explore their neighborhoods and interact with peers.
2. Provide opportunities for independence, such as letting older children navigate public transportation or explore areas like amusement parks with minimal supervision.
3. Enroll children in summer camps that ban phones, offering a chance for detox and immersion in real-world activities.
4. Support participation in team sports, which not only provide physical activity but also foster cooperation and social skills.

By prioritizing these real-world adventures and unstructured play time, we can help children develop independence, create lasting memories, and build the social and emotional skills necessary for their future success.

is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real world because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing we have to do is restore a really fun adventurous childhood like you know what you were saying you know you go out on your bicycle you're hanging out with your friends friends sometimes something happens and boy you have memories I mean exciting things happen scary things happen you have memories and you know I worry about like what you know what boys today you know I have a group of Buddy my group of friends that I you know we we still talk about things that happened you know things that amazing things that happened when we were in college or after college and I wonder

getting you guys outside um my parents did the same thing too like we I was very blessed to have two parents who didn't come you know they didn't have a lot of resources growing up they didn't come to this country with a lot of resources but the one of the greatest gifts they G gave us is that they loved us uncondition Al the other great gift that they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out", "look you guys actually you can see what this is doing to you you mostly agree that this is wasting your time it's garbage you you want to way out but you just feel like you can't there's such resignation um but look the cool kids over there they have flip phones and they're out like every day after school they're like you know they're doing stuff they're down at you know they're in the mall they're they're getting pizza they're you know building a fort uh you know whatever depending on the age um so I think the way out is to give kids an exciting childhood kids are so lonely now and and they they don't have much in the way of Adventure they don't have much in the way of Thrills um you know you know I live I live in New York City um you know I would start I would like bring my kids out to Coney Island when they were you know 9 10 years old bring them out and then I would just say I'm just going to sit here you guys run around you guys go have fun like I'm not going to be with you you know you know yeah there's a chance you'll get kidnapped or struck by lightning although lightning is more likely um so and then it you know and then it got once they were you know in more you know like like 13 now they can actually take the subway out to Coney Island with a friend so um that's cool", "but I worry that right now that we've almost somehow made that kind of unstructured time seem inefficient you know we've set these standards uh for our kids that they need to be uh you know getting fancy jobs and into fancy colleges and making an x amount of money and the path to doing that is you know to be enrolled in X number of activities after school and to do all this stuff in school and their lives are so hyper structured um that I worry that the time to just play to be creative to reflect and think to just have unstructured time with other kids has evaporated and I think that that also is hurting the mental health and wellbeing of our children I love the idea that that unstructured play time could be framed in the accurate context of the nervous system developing the way it was supposed to develop I mean I would argue that um success is going to be easiest for children that engage in the real world more in fact there's great risk to posting everything that you do online we've seen some examples of that preventing people from getting into or staying in college based on things they said or did previously that they shouldn't have said or done um that's those are kind of you know negative highlighted cases but in general um we know that the the nervous system thrives on diversity of types of interactions and social interactions in particular I'm just restating what you just said", "I mean it's crazy what happens so eight states have now said no no more of that this is insane um so we so law could help to put to to stop incentivizing helicopter parenting to provide uh uh more spaces that are safe for kids to play in not car zones um so the book has the exas generation the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "So the first gate is to arrive at learning at the appropriate level\nof autonomic arousal.\n\nClear and focused is best, but don't obsess over being\nright there, it's okay.\n\nIf you're a

the learning will be accelerated.\n\nSo there's really four things\nthat you really need to do for plasticity as an adult.\n\nAnd I would say that these\nalso apply to young people.\n\nAnd there's an interesting kind of a thought\nexperiment there as well, which is if you look at children, they are moving a lot\nin different dimensions.\n\nThey are sometimes hanging from trees.\n\nMy sports were always\nthings where I tended to get hurt a lot, fall a lot.\n\nSo it's skateboarding for\nme when I was younger, so a lot of falling and rolling and various things of that sort.\n\nBut whatever sport the kids are playing, or even if they don't play a sport, they tend to move in a lot of different relationships to gravity, more dimensionality to their\nmovements I should say, than adults.", "um the British have a saying don't put your daughter on the stage Mrs Worthington uh which is a line from an old nol coward song and it acknowledges that especially for girls for girls to grow up being

so yes in response to your question first summer camps are magic never send your child to a summer camp that doesn't ban phones because this is the best chance you have for a detox and I hear the story over and over again you know my I get my my girl got a an iPhone when she was was 11 she suddenly became sirly no longer the sweet funny child she was I sent her to summer camp the next summer and lo and behold the girl that comes back is my wonderful sweet 11-year-old you know she her personality is back and then she gets back on her phone and she becomes Surly again so summer camps are the most powerful technique known um for a detox because the kid isn't being deprived they are in a bunk with other kids with no phones and they're joking and talking and laughing and fighting and doing all those healthy things so summer camp is amazing the other thing that the evidence shows is that team sports and religion those two things are very very protective so I would strongly urge people um to encourage their kids to play team sports my kids run trap which is great but team sports Force more cooperation so there's some evidence that team sports are even better for their mental

on Friday no nothing on Friday Fridays you all get together you can start at anyone's house go out do what you want we'll even you know we'll give you you know we'll give you more allowance or we'll give you money to spend but go have experiences then it's fun it's not deprivation I love the uh trust in kids to sort things out and to be safe enough um at least the statistics say that they're more likely to thrive under those conditions than to be kidnapped or have something terrible happen I I like it also because it merges uh your previous book codling of the American mind um with the current book The anxious generation"]

Answer: 

COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) set the age for minors in contracts and data sharing at 13 years old. This law was passed in 1998 and was originally intended to set the age at 16, which was considered more reasonable. However, it was pushed down to 13 with little enforcement.

This age limit of 13 does not align well with today's views on kids' social media access. Many experts and parents now believe that 13 is too young for unrestricted social media use. For instance, Dr. Jonathan Haidt recommends delaying social media access until age 16, citing concerns about brain development and the potential negative impacts on mental health.

The current situation creates several problems:

1. Lack of enforcement: The law is written in a way that companies are not held responsible as long as they don't explicitly know a user is underage. This motivates platforms to avoid verifying users' ages accurately.

2. Ease of circumvention: Children can easily lie about their age to access social media platforms, as there's no robust age verification system in place.

3. Developmental concerns: At 13, the brain, particularly the prefrontal cortex, is still developing. This makes younger teens more vulnerable to the negative effects of social media.

4. Social pressure: With the current age limit, there's significant pressure on children to join social media platforms earlier than may be healthy for them.

Many experts, including Dr. Haidt, are now advocating for raising the age limit to 16 and implementing stronger age verification measures. This aligns more closely with current understanding of adolescent development and the potential risks associated with early social media use.

The discrepancy between the COPPA age limit and current views highlights the need for updated legislation and enforcement to better protect children's well-being in the digital age.

any attempt to regulate social media or any attempt to sue them is seen as like no no", "so I think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here too cuz Andrew my big concern with parents is look we've taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which we didn't grow up with as kids and we've told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this um you know when we were growing up you remember the motor vehicle fatalities were really high uh in America and we didn't say okay you know what that's just the price of Modern Life we just have to accept it and keep moving on with our lives we said hold on we don't have to go back to horses and Buggies but we also don't need to accept this death rate we need to make this experience safer and so we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups like Matt and others across the country that me Mothers Against Drunk Driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts airbags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that help helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents and deaths and that's what we need here too like we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting in place safety standards to protect kids from exposure to harmful content from from the experience of bullying and harassment and that also protect them from features that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use uh which is happening far too often right now we also need a policy that requires data transparency from the company you know researchers tell us all the time that they these are independent researchers they tell us they are having a hard time getting full access to the data from the social media platforms about the full impact of the platforms on the mental health of kids and as a parent look I I don't when we bought car seats for my children when when they were born we looked up the safety data like many parents we wanted to make sure the car seats were safe but if you had told me that hey you know the manufacturers of these car seats are actually not disclosing some of the the data on the impact on children uh but go ahead and buy it anyway", "oh these terrible devices um rather it's about a vision of childhood which is actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the reason why I got this far is because it's a set of collective action traps everyone every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone so the four recommendations I have are four ways of breaking out on the Trap but the first two are really about delaying and getting past this period of plasticity and you really help me see why it's so urgent to delay until late puberty at least so here are the four Norms that I think can break us out of this trap Norm number one uh no smartphone before high school you can give your kid a flip phone flip the Millennials had flip phones they came out fine no access or no smartphone of their own your own you can't have your own and that would even go for an iPad if you give your kid an iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it any you know anywhere in the house and you can take it outside even although maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the point is um the internet is an amazing thing and you know you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids and they can do things on the computer but you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to so it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone let them have a flip phone or a simple phone watch something like that that's rule number one rule number two is the most relevant for what we're just talking about and that is no social media until 16 there is I believe no way to make social media safe for children that is if they're going to be entering a domain in which Prestige is gained by having posts that get the most likes and followers you're making them be brand managers you're making them be performative this is not playful th", 'So,\n- Right.', "It's like-\n- Right. - Well-\n-", 'Like so-\n-', "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", '- Yeah-\n-', 'But-\n-', "but they haven't been the other is the sharing and we used to hear about pod parties where somebody buys the device which is more expensive buys the device and then you bring your own not beer bring your own pod which is a few dollars then you pop it in and then you share it around um we've also heard stories of a few teenagers buying them and then selling for a few cents or a few dollars a puff so meet me in the bathroom for 50 cents or a dollar you can have a couple of Puffs so I think teens are getting very very creative we've also seen unfortunately parents buying e cigarettes for their teens well at least they're not smoking cigarettes that's not the right comparison um so I think they're very creative they're getting into many many different ways I've heard students say I'm not using my lunch money to buy lunch I'm going to use it to buy Vapes um there's no one way uh there's not and unfortunately access is easier than it should by the way one thing I think is incredibly important for people to understand is across the US in 2019 December 2019 the legal age to be allowed to purchase or to sell nicotine products across the US is is become 21 so many people think it's so 18"]

Ground Truths: ["COPPA set the age for minors in contracts and data sharing at 13. This aligns with today's views on kids' social media access as there is a push to raise the age to 16, with concerns that the current age of 13 is not enforced and allows children to access social media without proper age verification."]

Answer: 

The purpose of implementing phone-free schools is multifaceted and aims to address several key issues related to student learning, development, and well-being.

Firstly, phone-free schools are designed to improve learning and focus. By removing smartphones from the classroom environment, students are better able to concentrate on their lessons and engage with the material being taught. This is particularly important given that smartphones are described as "the greatest distraction devices ever invented" and can significantly hinder a student's ability to pay attention to teachers and coursework.

Secondly, phone-free schools aim to reduce constant distractions. The context mentions a teacher who struggled with students constantly using their phones during class, with one student admitting to watching TikTok throughout the entire lesson. By eliminating these devices, schools can create an environment more conducive to learning and skill development.

Thirdly, implementing phone-free schools promotes real-world interactions and experiences. There's a concern that excessive phone use, particularly social media, is replacing valuable in-person social interactions and experiences that are crucial for child development. By removing phones, schools can encourage more face-to-face communication and engagement among students.

Lastly, phone-free schools address mental health concerns associated with excessive smartphone and social media use among young people. The context mentions rising rates of anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues potentially linked to smartphone use, particularly during sensitive developmental periods.

It's worth noting that implementing phone-free schools can be challenging. The context suggests that policies requiring students to keep phones in their pockets are often ineffective, leading to constant conflicts. More stringent measures, such as locking up phones in the morning or using specialized pouches, are recommended for successful implementation.

Overall, the purpose of phone-free schools is to create an environment that supports learning, reduces distractions, promotes real-world social skills, and potentially safeguards students' mental health during critical developmental stages.

Retrieved Contexts: ["so because if if it's true that puberty is a sensitive period for many higher level uh uh aspects of our Humanity such as identity relationship skills all that stuff then you should be extra careful when your kids are 9 to 15 years old you should be extra careful about what's going into their eyes and ears and instead that's when we give up all control you know when our kids are little they pay attention to us we read to them we have a lot of control about what our kids consume when they're toddlers And when they're very young but as they reach middle school and high school they're moving away they're seeking out other stuff and that's exactly what we say here here's your own device you want to go down a rabbit hole of eating disorder stuff you want to go down a rabbit hole of of you know of you know Tourette Syndrome um you're going to copy people who have these symptoms so the last thing we should be doing is exposing our children in this sensitive period to socializing information from random weirdos on the internet who were selected by an algorithm for the extremity of their behavior and the degree to which that extremity earned them likes which makes them extra prestigious um so yeah I laws that raise the age to 16 or 18 I think that's what we need um this is just not appropriate for minors even if there's some good stuff on it I think it's vastly outweighed by the bad so that's and that's the second Norm no smart no social media till 16 uh the third Norm is phone free schools and again you know if we expect kids to learn and learning is brain change if you're learning something you're developing a skill something about your brain has changed uh how about instead of learning math or reading or litter or anything else how about if you just do more phone stuff you just spend more time in school on Tik Tok there was just an article in the Washington in the Wall Street Journal about a teacher who fought against the phones and finally gave up and quit and one of the students in his classes quoted um that she used to she'd come into class and she would just go on Tik Tok and that's what she would do all class long is just watch Tik Tok in her desk um you know and like no you should be learning not doing more Tik Tok in school so it's just insane that we let kids take the greatest distraction devices ever invented into the classroom with them I would argue that they are learning but what they're learning are these rapidly reinforced dopamine Loops that lead to diminished amounts of dopamine not just in short periods of time but very quickly and that inhibit other forms of learning yeah that's right and the ability to pay attention right to to a teacher which is not as stimulating as what you're seeing on Tik Tok there's tons of learning it's but it's learning of all the wrong things that's right that's right", "so that's the third Norm is uh no uh is phonefree schools you have to lock up the phone in the morning either a lock in a phone lock or Yonder pouch um if the policy is you keep in your pocket that's not a policy that's just a recipe for constant conflict with the kids because they can't help it they have to text if anyone's texting they have to be texting and the fourth Norm is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real world because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing we have to do is restore a really fun adventurous childhood like you know what you were saying you know you go out on your bicycle you're hanging out with your friends friends sometimes something happens and boy you have memories I mean exciting things happen scary things happen you have memories and you know I worry about like what you know what boys today you know I have a group of Buddy my group of friends that I you know we we still talk about things that happened you know things that amazing things that happened when we were in college or after college and I wonder what boys young boys today are going to say you know you remember fortnite game 27363 where you were trapped in that Elevator Shaft and I had to shoot you out no I don't remember that one you know like uh the the virtual Adventures are just not going to cut it our kids need Adventure they need Independence and Adventure uh where they work out the conflicts themselves", "so I I point to that it's that 5-year period 2010 to 2015 which I've called the Great rewiring of childhood because it affects everything everything about what children and teenagers are doing I can recall in 2010 I was actually in New York City visiting friends I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting yeah nowadays I think of it less as addicting but almost um like an an OCD of sorts and here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD but the interesting thing about OCD is that the compulsions the behaviors don't serve to reduce the obsessions rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them and in many ways I feel like smartphone use and social media use in particular is a OCD of sorts it's not just habit it's not just an addiction it's an obsessive compulsive Loop so it's already a struggle to pay attention and you know ancient Traditions have have taught techniques to improve your focus your attention we're easily distracted and um you know so I don't work on my phone very much because I I hate to type on the phone and and I'm always at a computer but even for me sitting at my computer as soon as the thinking gets hard as soon as if I'm writing if I'm doing something that requires concentration some little part of my brain says I wonder what the weather's going to be and I go check the weather or you know oh did I get any email I go check my I might check my email you know probably 40 50 times a day and I know that's terrible so the question is is it a compulsion where I feel pulled I have to check it or something bad will happen no it's more like imagine trying to do your work imagine trying to be a kid in school and you have on your desk in front of you you have your television set your record player a walkie talk to talk to your friends a guitar a painting set all array in front of you and your teacher is telling you about you know geometry what are you going to do probably one of these things and so I think the smartphone where a flip phone it's it's a tool you pull it out if you want to talk to someone then you put it away but the smartphone there's no reason to ever put it away talk to us about the scary statistics there's just no way around this yeah", "I will say that a\ngraduate student in my lab who was immensely productive and focused, had the habit of coming in each day, she would take her phone, I\ndon't know if she turned it on, or off or not, and she would\njust place it in a door, excuse me, in a drawer and would then go start doing experiments.\n\nWe do experiments all day at 10 courses, engage in discussions\navidly with the rest of us, and then would take her phone out at the end of the day and leave.\n\nAnd I don't think that\nbehavior was not correlated with her immense productivity.\n\nI think the ability to untether\nourselves from the phone is going to be the way in which many of us are either going to succeed or\nfail in our various pursuits.\n\nI'm somebody who engages on with the phone on a regular basis throughout\nthe day for various reasons, but I do try and have\nlarge swaths of the day in which it's either on airplane mode or it's completely\nphysically separated from me.\n\nWhen I'm in large swaths,\nI might do every other hour with the phone on airplane mode or even a two or three hour\nabout where I just am simply not engaged with the phone at all.", "I I was delighted um it seems to me that if there was an understanding that the biology and psychology and sociology points to the fact that there is a critical period maybe not even a sensitive period but a critical period in which excessive smartphone use of a particular type is actually leading to more suicides depression anxiety and less learning and um adaptive behavior in life it seems to me that it should be a almost like a law it should be implemented at the level certainly at the national level what what sorts of barriers do you think exist to that um you know obviously I'm enthusiastic in joining your effort and and um I know many people listening will be as well to try and Implement these four things but what do you think it would really take to get people to take their children's brains and lives seriously because children can't be left to their own self-care to that degree it's just unfair right I mean it's like telling a kid in a candy shop like Hey listen you know figure it out you know there's nutritious food down the stre like it's unfair right it's like a puppy trying to trying to do the you know Westminster Championship it's like it's not going to happen um you know but this is serious stuff I mean we're talking about the future not just of the United States but of the entire species so um what about laws what about legislature how does that work I don't know anything about that sure well first so you know let's let's note you know I could be wrong about this um it might be that the phones aren't doing this now I think the evidence is pretty good that it is but let's suppose there's a 70% chance that I'm right let's Suppose there was only a 30% chance I was right the the consequences are so severe we should be taking action now what action to take I was over in the UK for the book about three weeks ago and in the UK you know and the rest of Europe the first thought of everyone is Ban it ban it ban it government law ban", "but but for one of the other negative effects right so we have the positive effects you talked about which is consolidation of learning and acceleration of learning we had the one negative effect which was the pavlovian connection to distraction the other I've written about before is Solitude deprivation right so so I'm using a different definition of solitude than the colloquial one most people think of it as a physical thing I'm I'm just isolated but there's a there's a cognitive psychological definition of solitude which means absence of stimuli created by other human Minds right so I'm not taking in information that's coming directly from another human mind uh having no period with this Solitude so having no period in your day where your free from stimuli creative from other Minds is Solitude deprivation and it's a real issue and partially it's a real issue because when we're processing input from another human brain it's all hands- on Deck right I mean we're very social beings a huge portion of our brain is dedicated to this right um so it's a very cognitively expensive activity when I'm trying to understand another human's what they're saying I'm simulating their mental state I'm trying to understand like where do they fall in this sort of social hierarchy and one of my arguments was um when you spend your entire day in that state it's exhausting and anxiety producing and like until we had smartphones and ubiquitous wireless internet the idea that you could banish all Solitude from your day is laughable it's just impossible right so of course we had a lot of portions of our day where our brain was not like ramped up in gear four like the sort of social processing mode but smartphones makes it possible that you can be in that mode all day long and so like one of the things I hypothesize is some of the anxiety Rises that goes with the age of smartphones is brain exhaustion right so that's like that's another negative effect of the const we have two negative effects now for the constant stimuli and one positive effect for the absence of the constant stimula so I think we're making a case here for not always being on your device", "Okay, so we talked about cannabis.\n\nWe talked about alcohol.\n\nLet's talk about cell phones.\n\nFirst of all, I use a cell phone.\n\nI use it very often.\n\nAnd I do not think they are evil devices.\n\nI think that they require some discipline in order to make sure that it does not become a\nnegative force in one's life.\n\nSo I personally restrict\nthe number of hours that I'm on the phone and in\nparticular on social media.\n\nI only answer email at\nparticular times of day.\n\nBut what about the cell phone itself?\n\nYou know, when I was a junior professor.\n\nI was a pre-tenure early professor.\n\nI taught this class on neural circuits in health and disease.\n\nAnd one of the students asked me, you know are cell phones\nsafe for the brain?\n\nAnd you know, all the data point to the fact that they were.\n\nOr at least there were no data showing that it wasn't.\n\nI still don't have the\nanswer on that, frankly.\n\nI don't see a lot of studies about it.", "so yes there is some evidence that overall phones and smartphones have increased risk behavior but it's more the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "I mean it's crazy what happens so eight states have now said no no more of that this is insane um so we so law could help to put to to stop incentivizing helicopter parenting to provide uh uh more spaces that are safe for kids to play in not car zones um so the book has the exas generation the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "it it's it's cropping up in different ways I'm meeting more and more some of these are organized efforts but I'm also meeting more uh families uh where the parents and kids together have decided that they're going to delay using social media and you know till past middle school or in some cases even later or where they're deciding that they're going to draw boundaries around social media use or they're going to replace their smartphone with a dumb phone that allows them to do things like text and make phone calls and use maps and and all that stuff but doesn't necessarily have social media apps on it now this is still a small minority and and we're dealing with a bit of a network effect here right because if you're the only one who's not on social media uh in your middle school class then you might feel left out which is why it's so important for parents to and and kids actually do this together", "Now in the digital realm,\nI already mentioned a few of the things that we\ncan do as practical tools to limit interruptions.\n\nOne is use the program Freedom, the other would be to\nsimply turn off the wifi.\n\nIf you do need to be\nonline and navigating, you're doing research of any kind, that's not going to be possible.\n\nTurning off one's phone, I've at times, put my phone on airplane\nmode, if that didn't work, I've locked it in a safe, I've done that, I'd left in the car outside.\n\nIt all depends on one's\nlevels of self-discipline, which as you probably know,\nfrom your own experience, tends to kind of wax and wane.\n\nSometimes we are better at avoiding these\ndistractions than others.\n\nSo if you find yourself in\na place where it's very hard to reduce those distractions, you may need you to go\nto more elaborate lanes.", "Danielle says, the top three\nmost impactful things schools could do to raise student\ncapacity for learning?\n\nWhat a great question.\n\nWell, I'll add a\nfourth because I don't want to try and\nwriggle out of the question by just saying sleep again.\n\nBut I think trying to\nget kids to sleep enough is going to be key.\n\nSo that means off\nphones and iPads in the middle of the night.\n\nThat means starting\nschool a little bit later.\n\nI don't know if that's\never going to work.\n\nBut that would be\na marvelous thing for learning because\nas you know, or we all should know or remember,\nneuroplasticity and learning is triggered by focused attention,\nwhich is supported by having slept well the night before.\n\nBut the actual rewiring of\nneural connections occurs when?\n\nIt occurs during sleep, it\noccurs during deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.\n\nThat's when the reorganization\nof neural connections occurs, the strengthening\nof particular synapses, the weakening of other synapses.\n\nAnd there's a small, small,\nsmall, perhaps infinitesimally small percentage\nof neuroplasticity that is the consequence of\nthe addition of new neurons.\n\nSo most neuroplasticity\nis not that.\n\nMost neuroplasticity\nis the reorganization of existing neural connections.\n\nBut nonetheless, that\nhappens during sleep.", "I think you'd have much better outcomes if that's part of what you learned at

having happy with me probably soon hate me now love me later as my mother used to say basically because I you know I'm I'm convinced having spent some time thinking about this writing about this doing some journalism on this talking to a lot of the experts that like I think where we're going to end up where all the the arrows from the the relevant social psych research which um I've been following This research since you know 2017 this is 2017 is roughly when you see the first warning signs going up that we need to worry about the potential mental health impact of these tools especially social media and smartphones on young people and I you can track this right I have a talk I I actually gave it my kids school not happy about this where I tracked how this research evolved and you know like any literatures it's contentious at first"]

Answer: 

Dopamine overshoot has dual impacts on addiction, particularly in relation to compulsive behaviors and emotions associated with social media use. 

Firstly, dopamine plays a crucial role in the development of addictive behaviors. When dopamine is released in high amounts, it tends to narrow focus and create a seeking behavior for more of the stimulus that triggered the release. This can lead to a progressive narrowing of the things that bring pleasure, which is a hallmark of addiction. In the context of social media, the immediate feedback and novel content can trigger dopamine release, potentially leading to compulsive checking and usage patterns.

Secondly, the emotional impact of dopamine overshoot is significant. While initial engagement with social media may produce high levels of dopamine release and associated pleasure, there appears to be a tapering effect over time. However, this doesn't necessarily reduce addictive potential. The pleasure-pain balance that underlies motivation means that even as the pleasurable effects decrease, the compulsive behaviors can persist. This is because dopamine is more associated with the anticipation and seeking of reward rather than the reward itself.

The emotional ties to social media are complex. While social media interactions can activate reward circuitry, they may not produce the same level of delight and persistent energy increase as in-person interactions. Nevertheless, the quick feedback loops and constant novelty of social media can create a compulsive, addictive quality similar to lever-pressing behavior observed in animal studies of addiction.

It's important to note that while social media use can trigger dopamine release, it's typically not to the same extreme levels as drugs like cocaine or amphetamines. However, the accessibility and ubiquity of social media make it a significant concern in terms of potential addictive behaviors.

The dual impacts of dopamine overshoot in this context are thus: 1) the initial high dopamine release that can lead to addictive patterns of use, and 2) the subsequent compulsive behaviors that persist even as the pleasurable effects diminish, driven by the dopamine-mediated anticipation of reward rather than the reward itself.

narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure.\n\nAnd a good life is a progressive expansion of the things that bring you pleasure.\n\nA rather simple definition, and yet when we think about\nthe biology of dopamine, dopamine is not unique to one pursuit.\n\nIt's not unique to the pursuit of sex or the pursuit of warmth when you're cold or cool environments when you're too warm or food or

homeostasis is.\n\nSocial homeostasis, just like hunger, is the process by which when\nyou lack social interaction, you start to crave it.\n\nWhat's very interesting about the fact that there are dopamine\nneurons in this raphe structure that is the effector\nfor social homeostasis, what this means is that\nwhen you are not interacting with people at a frequency or intensity, that is right for you, dopamine is released into the brain.\n\nIn most popular\nconversations about dopamine, and even in scientific circles, when you hear dopamine release, you think about reward or feeling good, because indeed many behaviors and drugs of abuse increase dopamine.\n\nThat's one of the reasons they have so much addictive potential.\n\nHowever, dopamine is not\nassociated with feeling good, it is actually the neurochemical that's responsible for movement toward things that feel good."]

Ground Truths: ['Dopamine overshoot in addiction leads to compulsive behaviors where individuals feel bad when not engaging in the addictive activity, similar to gamblers who believe the next attempt could change everything. This results in motivated reasoning and dashed hopefulness. In the context of social media, while individuals may be engaging out of compulsion, it does not necessarily feel good to them, leading to feelings of loneliness and anxiety. They may experience a lack of satisfaction despite receiving cheap and easy stimulation, which can cause them to become increasingly aware of the negative aspects of their online experiences.']

Answer: 

Myopia and nearsightedness are essentially the same condition, characterized by difficulty seeing objects at a distance while close-up vision remains clear. The relationship between this condition and screen time is complex and multifaceted.

Increased screen time, particularly when viewing devices at close range (within 2-3 feet), has been associated with a higher incidence of myopia, especially in children and young adults. This is due to the eye's adaptation to focusing primarily on near objects, which can lead to changes in eye shape over time.

When we spend extended periods looking at screens or other close-up objects, the eyeball can actually elongate. This elongation causes the visual image to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it, resulting in blurred distance vision – the hallmark of myopia.

However, recent research suggests that the relationship between screen time and myopia may be more nuanced than previously thought. While near work (such as reading or using screens) does play a role, the type and quality of light exposure may be equally, if not more, important.

Studies have shown that spending time outdoors, particularly in natural sunlight, can significantly reduce the risk and progression of myopia. This effect is believed to be due to the full spectrum of light available outdoors, including UVB and blue light, which may influence eye development and function.

One study published in the journal Ophthalmology in 2018 found that children who spent about 11 hours per week outdoors had a lower likelihood of developing myopia. The beneficial effects were observed even when children were reading or engaging in other near-vision activities outdoors.

To reduce the risk of myopia or slow its progression, experts recommend:

1. Balancing near and far vision activities throughout the day
2. Spending at least 2 hours per day outdoors in natural light
3. Taking regular breaks from screen time using the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds)
4. Ensuring proper lighting and ergonomics when using screens

It's important to note that while these measures can help, myopia can also have genetic components and other contributing factors. If you're concerned about your vision or that of your children, it's always best to consult with an eye care professional.

because uh you know myopia is so common uh it's more common um an Asian populations you know it's called an epidemic in China in California we have a lot of Asian Heritage or Asian Americans and so we see a lot like at Stanford we see a lot of um you know myopia in kids on adults and really starting to get thoughtful on the science of myopia control how do we how do we provide the right environments now what's interesting is that for decades the Assumption some of the data really led us to the path of thinking like gosh the more you spend near activities and these are Mouse model experiments like you described but also well-designed human cohort studies you know figuring out like asking you know kids and families like how long is your kid reading or in front of the computer how myopic are they how nearsighted are they versus how much time is your kid in front of the computer doing near work how myopic or nearsighted are they and these well-designed cohort studies did Point tour words this concept that if you do too much near work as a kid that you're more likely to develop nearsightedness as you get through those those sort of you know uh pre-teen and even into the teen years which is when most of that myopia progression or eyeball elongation is actually happening to cause nearsightedness it's only been in the last few years that some really exciting Studies have actually pointed in a slightly different direction and that's that maybe it's not all not to say it's not about near activity but maybe it's not all about near activity maybe it's actually a little more about the kind of light we're getting into our eyes and I think you've talked about this before", "In fact, it should\ncome as no surprise that the incidence of\nmyopia, of nearsightedness, is increasing dramatically\naround the world but is increasing\nparticularly fast in children and in young adults\nand even in adults who are viewing things at very\nclose range, so 2 and 1/2 feet or less.\n\nNow, I am not saying\nthat viewing things at 2 and 1/2 feet or less is bad\nfor your eyes, that is simply not the case.\n\nHowever, if you want your\nvision to be maintained or even improve, it's going\nto be very important for you to view\nthings at a distance as well for ideally\nseveral hours per day.\n\nNow, I realize some people just\nsimply won't accomplish this.\n\nIn fact, I'd like everyone\nto just take a moment and do a rough\nestimation in your head of how much time during\nyour daytime activities you are viewing things at,\nsay, 2 and 1/2 feet or 3 feet or less, so\nsmartphone, computer screen, paper, books, et cetera,\nversus viewing things that are 4 feet\naway, 8 feet away, so maybe conversation across the\ntable with another human being.\n\nRemember those?\n\nSome of us are\ndoing that more now that we seem to be emerging\nfrom this whole pandemic phase.\n\nHowever, many people are\nstill mostly just viewing things within very close range.", "In any case, the social media and staring at a small visual aperture is changing our brains.\n\nHere's one way I know in\nwhich it's changing our brains and then I'll tell you how to fix it.\n\nIf you stare or look at\nsomething within two feet of you for a certain number of hours each day, your eyeball actually gets longer.\n\nAnd the visual image then is focused in front of your neural retina,\nnot onto your neural retina, and you are becoming myopic; nearsighted.\n\nAnd if you look at things\nin the distance enough, guess what?\n\nYour eyeball changes shape\nand your lens will focus appropriately the image onto your retina.\n\nIt takes some work.\n\nKids that look at things\nup close too much, and adults that look at\nthings up close too much become nearsighted.\n\nAnd there's a beautiful\nset of clinical trials now where mainly in kids, if kids get outside for two hours a day, getting a lot of this UVB and blue light that we're told is so terrible for us, but they get it from sunlight, they actually can reverse myopia, or reduce the incidence of\nmyopia, maybe even glaucoma.\n\nAlthough that's a big maybe.", "and it's really important when they've now studied and asked the kids instead of just how much near and how much far are you doing how much time are you spending indoors in indoor lighting which doesn't have full spectrum light in a typical indoor environment versus how much time are you spending Outdoors playing in the yard you could be reading outside but what are you just what kind of time are you spending outside and and of course when you're outside in sunlight even it's in direct sunlight you're getting a different spectrum of kind of Full Spectrum Lighting from the sun and it looks like it's pretty clear now actually that it has maybe more to do with outdoor lighting time than just near work and so I think that you know we we've we've actually already seen the first couple randomized controlled trials where they're having kids intentionally spending time Outdoors versus sort of Standard Life which you know is going to be often much more indoor time and uh and seeing some effects you follow those kids over a couple of years and the kids who spend time Outdoors are are progressing in their nearsightedness less like they're they're nearsighted prescription is not getting as strong as the kid kids who are spending more time indoors and there's some pretty good biology that's getting worked out going back to animal models more about about how that might be working in the retina in this inside the eye but it's pretty compelling uh concept and and so you know as a parent uh you you may want to be you may want to be telling your kid like okay yeah I want you to read that book or you know if your kids plan on the phone or something like that or the iPad or something like that they're allowed that time okay you can have that time", "So I just want to briefly\ndescribe this study, because it's a very important one, and I don't think it's\ndiscussed often enough.\n\nThere are many studies exploring this, but one of the ones I liked the most, looked at 693 students, and a subset of them were encouraged to spend 11 hours a week outdoors.\n\nOkay, so most kids are in\nschool five days a week or so, so they're spending 11\nhours a week outdoors.\n\nThey are sometimes reading outdoors.\n\nThey're not always just playing outdoors, they might be reading books, et cetera.\n\nThey used eight different schools.\n\nAnd the reason they did the study, I probably should have mentioned, is that myopia, nearsightedness,\nis a global epidemic.\n\nAt least, that's how it was\nreferred to in the study.\n\nI don't know who decides\nwhat's an epidemic or not.\n\nI think there are thresholds for that.\n\nThis paper published in the\njournal Ophthalmology in 2018 described the fact that being\noutdoors for two hours a day could significantly reduce the probability that these children would\ndevelop nearsightedness.\n\nAnd it turns out based on other studies, that adults who spend\ntwo hours a day outside, that would be reading\noutside, talking outside.", "Now, what's really interesting\nabout these studies is that, while some of those kids are\nlooking at things further off in the distance than they\nwould if they were indoors on their tablets or screens\nor with their nose in a book, it does not seem to\nbe the case that they have to be looking at\nthings in the distance in order to see this\nreduced incidence of myopia.\n\nWhat's probably\nhappening instead is that the\nparticular wavelengths of light that\nemanate from the sun, that photon energy in\nparticular is triggering the activation of the\nso-called intrinsically sensitive melanopsin and retinal\nganglion cells, which we know are important for setting\ncircadian rhythm for enhancing mood focus and\nalertness during the day and enhancing the quality and\nduration of sleep at night.\n\nBut those melanopsin and\nintrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells are also\ninvolved in networks within the eye that\nrelate to blood flow, that relate to the\nciliary body, which is a structure within the eye\nthat controls the aperture and movement of\nsome key components within the eye, that also relate\nto the crispness of vision, that is the acuity of vision,\nat both short and long range.\n\nSo there are a lot of\ntechnical details there.", "And to make a long story short,\nwhat these studies show is that, if during development,\nyou or an animal exclusively looks at things\nthat are up close, very close to the eye, and doesn't\never get long-range vision, the eyeball lengthens.\n\nAnd when that happens the\nlens, which, of course, is in the front of\nthe eyeball, which focuses the light onto\nthe back of the eyeball, which is where the\nso-called neural retina is, where the cells\nthat sense light are, that visual image\nlands in front of as opposed to directly on\nthe light-sensing portion of the eyeball that we\ncall the neural retina.\n\nIt lands too close or near\nthe lens as opposed to on the back of the eyeball.\n\nAnd that's part\nof the reason what we call the consequence of\nthat nearsighted myopia.\n\nIn far sightedness,\nthe opposite happens.\n\nThe visual image is actually\nfocused behind the retina.\n\nIt doesn't land directly on the\nretina, which is what you want.\n\nIt's focused too far\nbehind the retina.\n\nAnd that's due to a\nshortening of the eyeball.", "So the short,\ndirect prescription here is to make sure that you're\ngetting at least an hour or so each day, although ideally it\nwould be more, of long viewing.\n\nAnd that could be done by\nwalking outside and avoiding looking at your\nphone while walking.\n\nIt doesn't require that you\nlook at a particular object in the distance, although if\nyou are scanning for and looking for objects in the distance,\nthe way that you might on a hike or you're looking out\ntoward or off a vista or you're looking for\nsomeone in the distance, all of that sort of\nvisual scanning behavior is going to be very\ngood for your eye health and for maintaining\nvision at a distance.\n\nIf you're somebody\nwho's far sighted and you have trouble\nseeing things up close, well, then you need to ask\nyourself whether or not you're spending too much\ntime looking at things off in the distance, although\nI want to be very clear that nearsightedness\nand farsightedness aren't necessarily the consequence\nof this near, far viewing.\n\nThere can be independent\ncauses of nearsightedness and farsightedness.", "Meanwhile, if the first\nbehavioral protocol for enhancing and\nmaintaining eye health is to make sure that you're\nspending at least some time balancing out the near vision\nand far vision during the day, it also stands to\nreason that you want to get outside for\nat least two hours a day, which I know sounds like a lot,\nin order to prevent myopia, if you're a young person,\nand offset the progression of and maybe even\nreverse some myopia, we don't know yet\nbased on the data, but there's some\nindication that's possible, by getting\noutside two hours a day.\n\nAnd the cool thing is, because\nmany people, including myself, have a lot of work to do and\nwe need to be on our phones quite a lot, or we choose to\nbe on our phones quite a lot, this effect of getting sunlight\noutdoors during the daytime for two hours or\nmore does not seem to require that you stay\noff your phone or tablet, or that you're looking at\nthings far in the distance the entire time.\n\nWhat this means\nis, if you can get outside onto a patio or a deck\nor an outdoor table if you can, if weather and\nconditions permit, and do some of your phone time\nand computer time and reading, et cetera, outdoors."]

Ground Truths: ['The relationship between myopia, nearsightedness, and the amount of time spent on screens is that spending excessive time looking at screens can lead to nearsightedness, as indicated by the observation that the eyeball lengthens with close viewing. However, spending two hours outside, even while using a tablet, has been shown to offset myopia.']

Connecting people through technology offers several significant benefits. One of the primary advantages is the ability to form meaningful connections and relationships with others, regardless of physical distance. These connections can contribute to our overall happiness and well-being, and research suggests that strong relationships can even correlate with living longer, healthier lives.

Technology enables us to communicate and express ourselves more easily, allowing us to share our experiences and stay updated on the lives of friends and family. This increased communication can foster empathy and understanding between individuals, as we gain insights into different perspectives and experiences.

Social media and online platforms can create opportunities for social bonding through shared experiences. For instance, when many people view the same content or participate in online discussions, it can lead to a sense of connection and shared understanding. This digital interaction can trigger similar physiological responses to in-person interactions, such as synchronization of heartbeats and activation of the oxytocin system, which plays a role in social bonding.

Technology also provides entertainment and learning opportunities. We can access a wealth of information and educational content, enriching our knowledge and providing inspiration. This aspect of technology can be particularly beneficial when used consciously and purposefully.

Additionally, technology offers increased efficiency and convenience in our daily lives. We can accomplish tasks, such as shopping or communicating, without the need for physical presence, which can save time and energy.

However, it's important to note that the benefits of connecting through technology depend largely on how it's designed and used. While technology can facilitate connections, it's crucial to balance online interactions with in-person relationships and be mindful of potential drawbacks, such as the risk of replacing meaningful face-to-face interactions with superficial online connections.

In conclusion, when used thoughtfully, technology can be a powerful tool for connecting people, fostering relationships, and enhancing our overall well-being. The key lies in leveraging its benefits while being aware of its limitations and potential pitfalls.

uh for many people it ended up leading to in-person connections being replaced with online connections um we came to somehow value and um almost seek out more and more followers and friends on social media feeling like somehow that made us more connected but the nature of dialogue also changed like as human beings we evolved over thousands of years to not just understand the words someone is saying but to hear the tone of their voice to see their facial expression like you and I are sitting across and and we're both processing like our body language right and I'm seeing you nod your head and I'm seeing your eyes focused like all of that matters to how we communicate um but also like you and I are less likely to say something hurtful right now to one another because we can see each other if I said something to hurtful to you like i' probably see the the pain or consternation on your face and that might give me pause right when you're communicating online with other people without any of that information or with any of the uh sort of barriers if you will that make you pause before you hurt someone it leads to a very different kind of communication uh one that can be quite hurtful at times", "MARK ZUCKERBERG: Sure.\n\nI mean, I think this is\na really important topic.\n\nThe research that we've\ndone suggests that it's not all good or all bad.\n\nI think how

the friendships that bring\nthe most happiness in our lives and, at some level,\nend up even correlating with living a longer\nand healthier life because that grounding\nthat you have in community ends up being\nimportant for that.\n\nSo I think that aspect\nof social media, which is the ability to connect\nwith people, to understand what's going on\nin people's lives, have empathy for

the costs are of certain actions we may still take those actions but we may find ways to mitigate the the costs we may in this case invest more in our relationships be more conscious about reaching out to other people going to visit at them uh but that has been a a quiet but but devastating Consequence the other piece with modernity is that we have more convenience in our life which means that we also don't need to see other people to get certain things done like buying groceries or mailing an item out or getting something from the store I can sit in the comfort of my home and have everything just come to me now on the one hand that's incredibly efficient right but I think efficiency is an interesting thing because it's only one factor we should be considering in our lives there too we have to ask the cost and one interesting thing about Co is many people in the first year of Co when we were all separated from one another you know when we finally came back together again I had so many people who said to me you know what I expected to miss my parents and my siblings and my friends not being able to see them what I didn't expect was missing the strangers that I saw at the coffee shop or the folks who I ran into the grocery store or seeing neighbors as I walked down the street like I actually missed that more than I thought I would so we have lost out on some of those interactions and those loose ties but the final thing to keep in mind also is about what is happening with how we are using social media technology which I think is fundamentally transformed how we interact with one another and how we see ourselves and each other and this is particularly true for young people uh who are growing up as digital natives but what has happened there I worry is that

Answer: 

Exposure to traumatic events can have significant and lasting impacts on brain response. Trauma can alter brain function in ways that persist long after the initial event, leading to changes in behavior, mood, anxiety levels, sleep patterns, and even physical health.

One of the primary effects of trauma on the brain is increased vigilance and a shift in how we perceive and interact with the world. The brain becomes more attuned to potential threats, leading to hypervigilance and defensive behaviors. This change is reflected in increased activity in certain brain regions, particularly subcortical structures like the amygdala, which is involved in threat detection.

Conversely, trauma tends to reduce activity in the prefrontal cortex, the area behind our forehead responsible for contextual planning, assessing outcomes, and maintaining our sense of self. This reduction in prefrontal cortex activity can impair our ability to process and integrate traumatic experiences effectively.

The impact of trauma isn't limited to acute, single events. Chronic traumas, such as ongoing denigration based on socioeconomic status, race, or gender identity, can also lead to significant brain changes. Additionally, vicarious trauma, experienced through exposure to distressing news or others' traumatic experiences, can have similar effects on brain function.

Trauma often triggers feelings of shame and guilt, which can become deeply ingrained and influence future behavior and self-perception. The emotional impact of trauma doesn't adhere to normal time perception; the limbic system, which processes emotions, doesn't differentiate between past and present. This can cause traumatic memories to feel immediate and present, even long after the event has passed.

It's important to note that trauma's impact on the brain can manifest in various ways, including changes in mood, anxiety levels, sleep patterns, and even immune system function. The interconnectedness of the brain and body means that traumatic experiences can have far-reaching effects on overall health and well-being.

Understanding these neurological impacts of trauma is crucial for developing effective treatments and interventions. Approaches that help regulate emotional responses, increase prefrontal cortex activity, and process traumatic memories can be beneficial in addressing the long-term effects of trauma on brain function.

Retrieved Contexts: ["So the way that trauma\ncan change our brains and stay with us in a way\nthat says, be more vigilant, look at the world in a different way, act more defensively, right?\n\nAnd how that links to shame and to guilt, and then guilt in, guilt becomes what gets\ncalled feeling technically where we relate the aroused\naffect to ourselves, right?\n\nSo, shame the aroused affect and guilt, the next step, right?\n\nWhen the shame gets related\nto self are such profound behavioral interventions\nand deterrents, right?\n\nThat you can see, I think how evolutionarily\nkind of all

the horrors that are in front of us.\n\nAnd it shows how yes, trauma can come through acute\nthings that happen to us.\n\nTrauma can come through chronic\nthings, chronic denigration, whether it's based upon\nsocioeconomic status, immigration status, race, religion, sexuality, gender identity, these\nchronic traumas, right?\n\nOf being denigrated by\nthe society around us, or treated as less than\ncan change the brain.\n\nBut vicarious experiences can too, right?\n\nAnd we know this is not theoretical.\n\nWe know that the changes in the brain can come from vicarious experiences too, which is why people who\nare glued to the news and then feeling like, oh my goodness, like what is happening?\n\nThe mothers in the Ukraine who've lost babies in the war.\n\nAnd like, there are things\nthat are so terrifying that if we spend so much time with that, it has a similar effect.", "- Right, I think traumas that we might categorize\nas disappointments, right?\n\nOr things that are are negative, but not deeply impactful, I think is not a helpful\ndefinition, right?\n\nI think the helpful definition\nis something that rises to the magnitude of really\nchanging us and something that we can see both in how we behave.\n\nWe can see it in mood, anxiety, behavior, sleep, physical health.\n\nSo we can identify it and we can also see it in brain changes.\n\nSo the fact that we become, say more hypervigilant, right?\n\nMore vigilant, and then we can see that\ndifferent parts of the brain are more active.\n\nSo that definition, that definition captures how trauma, if it rises to a certain\nlevel, like what we would say, trauma that makes a post\ntrauma syndrome, right?\n\nLeaves us different, I think is the helpful\ndefinition of trauma because it's a clinical definition, right?\n\nIt's changes in us as people and we can map those changes to identifiable shifts\nin our brain function.", "and then if you recall the third thing that's critical to include it's about any links or associations between what happened and really anything at all so if you think about it all three of those things in that list are really about tapping into your neural map or your schema as it's sometimes called or your internal representation both conscious and unconscious of what happened during that stressful or traumatic event now a Hallmark feature of traumas as well as a Hallmark feature of addictions as well as a Hallmark feature of compulsive behaviors or negative habitual behaviors and negative habitual States like chronic stress anxiety the sorts of things that trigger insomnia the sorts of states of body that trigger immune compromise and give us autoimmune or other types of immune system challenges are that a certain component of our nervous system and our brain in particular are less engaged than they normally would be in the healthy condition now I want to be clear that in any one of these conditions whether or not it's irritable bowel syndrome or it's fibromyalgia or it's chronic anxiety or depression there are many many different brain centers and networks that is stations within the nervous system of the brain and body that are involved I really want to emphasize this there's no one location in the brain for instance for fear or anxiety it's always a network phenomenon the relative activation of different brain centers at different times and so on but with respect to thinking about traumas and stressful experiences we have to ask ourselves what is it about the emotional states and all the mapping the representation around those emotional experiences that would somehow impact our immune system like our thymus of all things or our bone marrow or conversely what would it be about a stressful experience that would impact our heart rate that would somehow then also change our brain so the mechanism that seems to be a sort of Smoking Gun of sorts that is the mechanism that really does seem to be at least one of those Lynch pin mechanisms is that when we experience very stressful or traumatic experiences our prefrontal cortex the neural real estate that's just behind our forehead which has several different subdivisions in fact is reduced in its overall levels of activity and other areas of the brain that sometimes are referred to as the limit LIC areas of the brain although if we were to be more accurate than that the modern Neuroscience really refers to these as subcortical structures they aren't necessarily lyic structures per se although they can include components of the lyic system so they can include things like the hypothalamus so this dense collection of neurons that resides over the roof of your mouth that's involved in things like aggression or temperature regulation sleep wake cycles and so on as well as structures that perhaps you've heard more about such as the amygdala which is involved in threat detection but other structures as well all of which are subcord cortical now those subcortical structures can be compared in a fairly General but still accurate way to the prefrontal cortex which is involved in contextual planning involved in assessing outcomes if I do a what will happen if I do B what will happen the prefrontal cortex is also associated with our self-concept of our identity who we are what we are about what we value what motivates our decisions to do or to not do things so I don't want to create any false impressions that the prefrontal cortex is somehow a more evolved structure than the subcortical and lyic structures but in some sense it is it's involved in more quote unquote sophisticated functions or at least functions that involve us really thinking and being able to place a coherent Narrative of what happened in the past what's happening now and what's likely to happen in the future if conditions a b or c happen to arise", "- So how do we know if we've\nbeen changed by something?\n\nI mean, I can think\nback to childhood events where some kid on the playground or in the classroom said something, I didn't like, something\nnegative about me.\n\nI think most people can do that.\n\nWe have a great memory for the kid that said something awful, or the parent or teacher\nthat said something awful that really felt like it hurt\nus or at least stuck with us.\n\nSo clearly one's brain, my brain in this example has been changed by that event such that I remember it, but how do we know if something has actually changed the way that we are?\n\nBecause of course we don't\nknow how we would be otherwise. -\n\nRight, right.\n\n- That's difficult, right.\n\nIt's doable, but it's\ndifficult because the response, so if the trauma rises to the\nlevel of changing our brains and I don't just mean, like\nwe have a new memory, right?\n\nSo we can have memories of something that was negative, right?\n\nAnd in that sense, it changes the brain because now there's something we can call to mind, but it doesn't change the\nfunctioning of the brain, right?", "But there's a way of understanding it\nthat, because the limbic system, the emotional parts of our minds don't\ncare about the clock and the calendar.\n\nSo trauma impacts, it impacts\nthe whole brain, but trauma impacts the limbic system.\n\nIt creates strong negative emotion that\nthen stays with us regardless of time.\n\nIt doesn't care about time.\n\nSo imagine now a person gets in a\nrelationship and the relationship starts to become abusive.\n\nI mean, it's easy to say that and\nthen move on to something else.\n\nWhat's that like for that person?\n\nWhat does that feel like when\nthat person, who they may have seen as a protector, a friend, is\nnow cursing at them, denigrating them, pushing them, hitting them?\n\nI mean, it's terrifying.\n\nIt's horrible, right?\n\nSo it is a deep impact, a t\nraumatic impact on the person.\n\nAnd a lot of the time, most of the time,\nlike all trauma, it triggers shame.\n\nSo trauma triggers shame in us.\n\nIf the trauma is strong enough, it changes\nus as we move forward in the world.\n\nAnd then we are different\nin a way that makes the past very immediate in the present.", "The Neuroscience of fear has\na long history in biology and in the field of psychology.\n\nHowever, I think it's fair to\nsay that in the last 10 years, the field of Neuroscience has\nshed light on not just the neural circuits, meaning\nthe areas of the brain that control the fear response\nand the ways that it does it, but some important ways\nto extinguish fears using behavioral\ntherapies, drug therapies, and what we call brain machine interfaces.\n\nToday, we are going to\ntalk about all of those, and you're going to come away\nwith both an understanding of the biology of fear and trauma, as well as many practical tools\nto confront fear and trauma.\n\nIn fact, we are going to discuss one very recently published study in which five minutes a day of deliberate exposure to stress was shown to alleviate\nlongstanding depressive and fear related symptoms.\n\nWe will get into the details\nof that study and the protocol that emerges from that study\na little later in the podcast.\n\nBut it stands as a\nreally important somewhat counter-intuitive example of\nhow stress itself can be used to combat fear.", "Now, remember that the circuit for fear, the circuit for trauma\ninvolves this generic reflex.\n\nAnd then there are those top-down elements coming from the forebrain.\n\nIt's very clear because it's been measured that if you look at the amount of anxiety, the pure physiological anxiety response of quickening of heart\nrate, flushing of the skin, sometimes quaking of the hands, that the experience of fear over time when people recount or retell their trauma that the first time they do that especially when it's\nrecounted in a lot of detail there's a tremendous anxiety response.\n\nSometimes even as great or\ngreater than the actual exposure to the fearful event or trauma.\n\nAnd obviously this is\nsomething that is done with a clinician present, because it is very\ntraumatic to the person.\n\nThey're literally reliving the\ntrauma in full rich detail, and they are encouraged to\nprovide full rich detail.\n\nThey're often encouraged to\nspeak in complete sentences to flush out details about\nhow they felt in inside, to flush out details about their memories going into this traumatic\nor fearful event, going through it.\n\nAnd after really digging\ninto all the nuance and contours of these\nhorrible experiences.", "No in fact the opposite is true we know that being under I conditions of duress or stress or trauma reduces activity in the prefrontal cortex and here we're saying recalling that trauma and stress in ways that are highly emotional and negative is actually increasing ongoing activity in the prefrontal cortex and indeed yes that is the case so how could that be during development neuroplasticity is a passive process whatever we are exposed to changes our brain in a way that allows us to more reliably predict the future right that's one of the key functions of the brain but as an adult meaning from age 25 onward and really that's not a strict cut off could be late teens maybe 19 all the way up to say age 120 which we think is perhaps the maximum lifespan that humans could possibly reach we don't know most people don't reach 120 but let's say from 19 all the way up to 120 we know that neuroplasticity is created when the nervous system goes into states that are atypical as compared to our normal waking States and one of the key triggers for neuroplasticity is when we have high levels of the so-called catacol amines dopamine epinephrine Endor norepinephrine in our brain and body that creates a state change that we call autonomic nervous system shift where we have elevated heart rate more distress High degrees of emotionality it is highly uncomfortable often and yet that signals to the neural tissue hey something's happening here and we need to rewire we need to change and the actual rewiring occurs during deep sleep sleep and states such as non-sleep deep rest or anytime we're in a deep relaxation State some of you have heard me talk about neuroplasticity before but the key elements to remember for today's discussion is that these states of heightened levels of emotionality are the trigger for neuroplasticity and that the actual rewiring of neural connections happens in sleep and states such as non-sleep deep breast so if we were to be completely logical we would sit back at this point and say okay"]

Answer: 

Independence and free play are crucial for children's development, playing a significant role in shaping their cognitive, social, and emotional skills. Unstructured playtime provides children with essential opportunities to explore, experiment, and learn about the world around them in a low-stakes environment.

One of the key benefits of free play is its impact on social development. During unstructured play, children learn how to negotiate situations with peers, resolve conflicts, and recognize non-verbal cues in others. These experiences help them develop crucial social skills like collaboration, empathy, and communication.

Play also serves as a testing ground for children to explore different roles and contingencies. As they transition from self-centered play to more cooperative forms, children learn important lessons about sharing, taking turns, and understanding that the world doesn't revolve around them. This process helps them develop a sense of identity and their place within social groups.

From a neurological perspective, play is fundamental in shaping the brain's neural connections. Through various forms of play, children strengthen certain neural pathways while pruning away unnecessary connections. This process is critical in developing the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive functions like decision-making, problem-solving, and emotional regulation.

The significance of childhood play extends well into adulthood. The ways in which children engage in play during their formative years can have lasting impacts on their adult behaviors, preferences, and even leadership styles. Play experiences help establish the neural foundations for how individuals approach challenges, interact with others, and adapt to new situations throughout their lives.

In essence, independence and free play provide children with a safe space to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from their experiences. These unstructured activities are vital for developing creativity, flexibility, and resilience – skills that are essential for success and well-being in adulthood.

really are about testing out how we feel comfortable or uncomfortable, how we react good or bad, how we react with stress or with glee when others behave in certain ways.\n\nAnd so what I'm hoping is coming through is that play is not just about having fun.\n\nPlay is about testing.\n\nIt's about experimenting and it's about expanding\nyour brain's capacity.\n\nAnd that's through early in development, and it's through throughout the lifespan.\n\nSo at this point in the discussion, I want to take a step back, look at the biology and\nneurochemistry of play just a little bit.\n\nAnd that really define\nwhat is effective play.\n\nIf the goal of play is to\nexplore different contingencies in low stakes environments and to expand the function\nof our prefrontal cortex so that we can see new possibilities and new ways of being become\nmore flexible, more creative, more effective outside\nof the games of play or the arenas of play, I should say.", 'But in all seriousness Burton White\'s "Toddlers Creed" is really grounded in this transition from\nwhen we are infants.\n\nAnd we have to have\nthings delivered to us, to the point where we are toddlers and we can access things in the world, but we tend to assume\nthat they are all ours.\n\nAnd then the next stage is the really key stage\nas it relates to play because is in the next\nstage of development is where young children start to interact with other children and there\'s an exchange and a possession and then a letting go of certain things, learning that not everything is yours and that the entire world is not about you is one of the key contingencies that is established during play.\n\nIt\'s one of the key way\nin which children go from being very self-centered and basically unable to\nengage with other kids for very long, without some sort of eruption of crying and some sort of battle of, you know, kind of push pull over an object to things like sharing and\nthings like cooperative play.', 'So as we transition from forms of play that are all about the self that are all me, me, me, me, "The Toddlers Creed" to forms of play that involve some discomfort in assuming roles that maybe we don\'t want and\nnot getting what we want.\n\nIt\'s really an opportunity for the brain to start to explore different\nroles that people take, how they work as individuals and as pairs and in larger groups.\n\nAnd to do that in a low\nstakes environment, right?\n\nYou wouldn\'t want this to be worked out on the battlefield or\nwhen searching for food or in some high stakes environment where the

they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of

in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out", "So we establish that play is homeostatic, meaning we all need to do it.\n\nMany of us, including myself, haven't played that much as adults.\n\nWe're all pretty busy.\n\nNumber of us are stressed.\n\nWe got a lot to do in life, but as children, most all of us engage in a lot of play.\n\nAnd in looking at the way\nthat very young children and especially toddlers play, we can learn a lot because it reveals the fundamental rules by which the toddler brain\ninteracts with the world.", "One of my favorite things\nabout developmental biology and developmental psychology is that it is grounded in the fact that we don't just have a\nchildhood and an adulthood.\n\nThere isn't just our child\nself and our adult self.\n\nAnd even though there\nare transitions around the mechanisms that\nunderline neuroplasticity at approximately age 25, it is simply the case that development is our entire lifespan, that our lifespan is one\nlong developmental arc.\n\nHow long depends on our\ngenetics, our lifestyle accidents, injury and disease of course, but it is one long developmental arc.\n\nAnd so it shouldn't surprise us at all that how we learn to play as\na 10 year old or 12 year old would impact how we play\nand interact with people as a teenager and a young adult and on and on and on.\n\nAnd that play is the\nplace in which we explore in which we learn play is the substrate by which our nervous system changes us from this hyper-connected\nbatch of neurons, where everything is\nconnected to everything, more or less to a brain and nervous system whereby certain circuits work\nwith immense proficiency and others are less accessible to us.", "Indeed that's what happens when children play when adolescents play and when young adults play, whether or not it's social play or play with an object, whether or not it's a\nsport or a play of any kind imaginary play imaginary friend play, there is a strengthening of\ncertain neural connections and a pruning away of up to 40%, perhaps even more of connections that are not necessary for\ncertain types of behaviors, emotions, and thoughts.\n\nAnd what this means is that it is through the process of play, that we become who we are as adults.\n\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, it is through the process of play that we are able to adjust\nwho we are as adults.\n\nNow, there are bounds on this process, as far as I know there's\nnever been a reported case of an individual who had a hyperplastic or I should say a brain that\nwas as plastic in adulthood as it was in childhood.\n\nBut what this tells us is that what we do in the process\nof play as children is really how we set up the rules for how we behave as adults\nin almost all domains, which is really incredible.", "The number of questions\ngoes on and on and on.\n\nAnd I will provide a link to a paper that asks a number of questions that helps you arrive at\na sort of score of sorts or an index of what Güneş\nand others have referred to as personal play identity.\n\nThe point is that if we look back to our early adolescence, somewhere between 10 and 14 years old, a peak time for social development, a peak time for play of various kinds, a peak time for motor development, a peak time of psychosocial development, where we learn where we\nfit into hierarchies.\n\nAs we relate to members of the same sex of the opposite sex, et cetera, we can start to get a portal into how and why we show up to\nvarious activities in work and relationship, et cetera, as adults.\n\nIn fact, I'll venture to say that\nif we go into that process for ourselves for five or 10 minutes, you start to see some remarkable parallels between the way you were at that stage and your tendencies and\nyour preferences as adults.", "Play is something that\nnormally we associate with children's games and indeed with being a child, much of our childhood\ndevelopment centers around play, whether or not it's organized play or spontaneous play, but as adults, we also need to play.\n\nAnd today I'm going to talk about what I like to refer to\nas The Power of Play.\n\nThe Power of Play,\nresides in plays ability to change our nervous system for the better, so that we can perform many activities, not just play activities, better.\n\nPlay can also function as a way to explore new ways of being in different scenarios in work, in relationships, in settings of all kind, and indeed also in the\nrelationship to oneself.\n\nIn fact, we are going to explore how\nassuming different identities during the same game of play or the same forms of play has been shown to be immensely powerful for allowing people to engage in more creative thinking and dynamic thinking and\nindeed to better leaders and more effective workers and students and learners\nand happier people."]

Ground Truths: ["Independence and free play are significant in children's development as they help restore a fun and adventurous childhood, allowing children to create memories through real-world experiences. These experiences foster independence and adventure, enabling children to work out conflicts themselves rather than relying on virtual adventures."]

Answer: 

Several actions have been taken to protect parents from being accused of neglect when advocating for children's play. One significant effort comes from an organization called "Let Grow," co-founded by Dr. Jonathan Haidt and Lenore Skenazy. This organization advocates for returning play to children's lives and has made substantial progress in changing laws to protect parents.

Let Grow has successfully lobbied for legislation in eight states that explicitly states that allowing a child to play outside unsupervised cannot be used as evidence of child neglect. This is a crucial step in protecting parents who want to encourage independent play for their children.

The need for such legislation arose because of ambiguous laws and changing social norms. In recent decades, it has become increasingly uncommon to see children playing unsupervised, leading to situations where well-meaning neighbors or passersby might report parents for neglect. These reports could escalate quickly, involving police and child protective services, potentially leading to severe consequences for families.

The new laws passed in these eight states aim to prevent such scenarios. They provide legal protection for parents who allow their children age-appropriate independence and outdoor play. This legislative action is a significant step in advocating for children's play while simultaneously protecting parents from unwarranted accusations of neglect.

In addition to legal efforts, organizations like Let Grow are working to change societal perceptions about children's independence and play. They advocate for creating more safe spaces for children to play, especially in areas that are not dominated by car traffic.

While these efforts are primarily focused on the United States, they represent a growing recognition of the importance of unstructured play time for children's development and the need to support parents in providing these opportunities without fear of legal repercussions.

where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "whatever but um but kids need to be out playing with each other especially Outdoors we evolved in savanas we evolved in different parts of the world we're attracted to Nature um so that's the way it it always was now uh

course Pearl Harbor did more for American Co coherence than anything else in history in modern history 911 did that too but only for a little while and then we we lost it um so for a a lot of reasons people trusted their neighbors kids were out playing you know my parents grew up in the depression in New York City the kids were all out playing stickball on the street or in a parking lot in the 1970s there is a real crime wave um crime goes through the roof actually and it goes through the 80s that goes all the way to the early 90s even still you were kicked out of the house to go play um even in New York City all kids went out to play that's just the way it was but we begin to lose trust in each other for a lot of reasons Robert putam wrote about this in Bowling alone the the the the loss of Social Capital many reasons for that the changing media environment air conditioning and television people are not hanging out on their porch in the summertime to get away from the Heat they Clos the door and they put on the AC and they watch TV family sizes are shrinking there are not that many kids around so for a lot of reasons by the the 90s is the key decade where act two of the

where I think while yes uh and we we'll we should we'll talk about some steps parents can take because I want to get to practical steps of people who are here as parents or people have kids in their lives can take but we we we need policy makers to step up and step into the void here and to fill the Gap because this is too much again to just ask parents to manage entirely on their own and this isn't again about telling parents what to do and restricting them this is about giving them the support they need so they have confidence uh when they see uh you know a technology out there a device out there a product out there for kids that they know it's been tested that it's been studied and that it's actually safe for their children my understanding is that in uh countries like China there are limit as to how many hours kids can be on screens period", "most Instagram no so it the the huge time suck is the videos so it's actually Tik Tok and YouTube are counted in this analysis they're counted as social media YouTube is marginally social media it's more of an general information Source but the point is especially the short videos the short videos are really really addictive because the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the house every day to go play my mom would say get out of the house I now realize she wanted space yeah"]

Answer: 

One of the main functions of the prefrontal cortex in relation to the hypothalamus is to provide inhibitory control over the hypothalamus's impulse-driven actions. The prefrontal cortex has extensive connections with the hypothalamus, which is responsible for many motivated drives and basic functions like temperature regulation, sexual drive, hunger, and aggression.

The prefrontal cortex acts as a kind of "brake" on these brain centers, including the hypothalamus. It can suppress or quiet the activity of the hypothalamus through a process called top-down inhibition. This inhibitory function allows for more context-specific behavior and thinking, rather than purely reflexive or impulse-driven actions.

For example, the prefrontal cortex enables us to override reflexes or resist urges that originate from the hypothalamus. This ability to suppress impulses is crucial for complex decision-making and social behavior. It allows us to stay in situations that might be uncomfortable (like a cold shower) or to resist immediate gratification in favor of long-term goals.

This inhibitory relationship between the prefrontal cortex and the hypothalamus develops significantly during puberty and continues to be refined throughout adulthood. The ability of the prefrontal cortex to suppress hypothalamic impulses is a key aspect of what makes human behavior flexible and adaptable to different contexts.

within the ventromedial hypothalamus just nearby and uh you'd want to go spend some time with your wife alone let's just put it that way I mean a remarkable specificity of the neuronal outputs to behavioral change and state change so all of that gets set up essentially during puberty because the neurons of the hypothalamus are responsive to these hormones that are coming from the gonads and in

ability through what's called top-down inhibition to quiet other brain areas so for instance if you are feeling agitated but you need to sit still your ability to sit still even if it takes a bit of work is coordinated by your prefrontal cortex sending inhibitory suppressive electrical signals to the networks of your brain that are trying to generate physical action in addition to that if you are in a conversation that's either a difficult one or a boring one or you are tempted to interrupt and you are actively holding back your desire to walk away or to yawn or to blurt something out it's your prefrontal cortex that is controlling that active suppression so in many ways you can just think of the prefrontal cortex as an Orchestra conductor that is essentially saying shh or not right now be quiet this is not the time to many different brain networks all at once now in addition to that your prefrontal cortex is coordinating with other brain networks that are involved in generating

Answer: 

The period from 2010 to 2015 saw significant technological advancements that revolutionized communication and, consequently, boosted knowledge sharing and productivity. 

One of the most impactful changes was the widespread adoption of smartphones. By 2015, the majority of Americans, especially teenagers, had smartphones equipped with front-facing cameras. This shift from flip phones to smartphones transformed how people communicated and accessed information. Smartphones allowed for more versatile and immediate communication options beyond just calls and texts.

The introduction of social media platforms designed specifically for smartphones, such as Instagram, further changed the communication landscape. These platforms enabled users to share information, experiences, and knowledge in real-time through visual and textual content.

Another crucial development was the availability of high-speed internet and unlimited texting plans. This combination allowed people to stay connected and communicate more frequently and efficiently than ever before. The ability to access information and communicate at any time and from anywhere significantly enhanced knowledge sharing and productivity.

The smartphone revolution also meant that people had instant access to vast amounts of information at their fingertips. As one expert noted, "You don't have to have a neural interface embedded in your brain to get information, essentially access to all information in the world. You just have to have, you know, your iPhone." This immediate access to information undoubtedly contributed to increased knowledge and productivity.

However, it's important to note that these technological advancements also came with challenges. The constant connectivity and information flow led to issues such as increased distractions and the need for better time management. Additionally, the shift towards digital communication sometimes came at the expense of in-person interactions, which can be crucial for certain types of communication and relationship-building.

In conclusion, the technological changes from 2010 to 2015, primarily centered around the widespread adoption of smartphones and associated technologies, significantly boosted knowledge sharing and productivity by enabling more efficient, versatile, and immediate communication. However, these advancements also brought new challenges that needed to be addressed to fully harness their potential.

did all this start prior right yeah well actually if it's okay with you I'll answer that by giving sort of the the history because the short answer would be 2010 to 2015 but it'll make more sense if I just sort of go through how we got there so changes in technology when you connect people more you get roads you get telephones these things are all great um they lead to massive gains in knowledge productivity yes sometimes they're disruptions but in the history of humanity they've been great um the internet was that when you know you and I are old enough to remember do you remember the first time you saw a web browser I do and it was like you mean I just like I type in a question and I get the answer I don't have to go to the library it was I mean it was miraculous um and and I can talk to people for free and we had that by email which was free so in general Connecting People is good", "and we were all very optimistic about the internet in the 1990s it was amazing and in our conversation today I want to make it very clear the internet is absolutely amazing this is not about how the internet is bad um smartphones or the iPhone you know is absolutely amazing although there's some things about it that are problematic it's really especially social media which has changed things and so um if we if we look at a kid let's take a teenager in 2010 and let's say January 2010 at that point there's no Instagram there's no front-facing camera um they all have mostly they have flip phones the iPhone came out in 2007 uh but they don't mostly have them so in 2010 most teenagers are using the flip phone as a tool to call each other call each other text each other meet up so when technology helps us achieve our goals that's good by 2015 everything's different by 2015 the great majority of Americans certainly teens have a smartphone with a front-facing camera the girls are mostly on Instagram which was the first social media platform that you had to be on a smartphone for everything else was web based um they have High-Speed Internet unlimited texting and now it's possible to spend 10 15 hours a day on your phone you nobody could do that with a flip phone", "um I spent a lot of time studying that closely right from like a techn critic standpoint the introduction of digital communication to the workplace and the problem there is the reason why we're checking this all the time it's not some like individual habit deoptimization it's not oh I should just check this less often what happened is when we introduce low friction digital communication to the office this emerging consensus came about that said great let's just use ad hoc messaging as our major way of collaborating like we can just figure things out on the fly I can just be like Andrew what's going on with the whatever and you can answer me and I can send it back um this was very convenient the activation cost was low and so this is how we began actually collaborating on work now what happens is as workloads get higher we now have many things at the same time they're all generating these asynchronous back and forth conversations most of these have some sort of time sensitivity right so if I email you and say like what's going on with like the guest coming later today we have to kind of resolve this before later today um so now it's not just that these messages are going back and forth with all these different threads", "So I do think that,\nprovided the technology continues to emerge the way that it does, that it's going to be around the corner, and it probably is not going to be in ways that are super obvious.\n\nI don't think it's going to be like, can we easily memorize\nevery fact in the world, but in forms that are going\nto be much more incremental and maybe more subtle.\n\nIn many ways, we already have that now.\n\nLike, for example, you don't\nhave to have a neural interface embedded in your brain to get information, essentially access to all\ninformation in the world.\n\nYou just have to have,\nyou know, your iPhone.\n\nWhether you could do it faster\nthrough a brain interface, I definitely wouldn't rule that out.\n\nBut think about this, that the systems that we have already to speak and to communicate have evolved over, you know,\nthousands and millions of years and they're supported by neural structures that have bandwidth of\nmillions of neurons.\n\nThere is no technology\nthat exists right now that people are thinking about\nthat are in commercial forms, certainly not even in research labs, that come anywhere close to what has been evolved\nfor those natural purposes.", "so I think it was a real quandry my argument is what essentially the management class came up with is p productivity which is okay in the absence of being able to be quantitative about this we will use visible activity as a proxy for useful effort so that's it like we see you doing things that's better than not the more we see you doing the better I call that pseudo productivity and I think that's implicitly how we've been organizing the management of knowledge work labor since the 1950s and when you say ability at people doing things this is the um conflating of busyness with actual productivity yes and so the problem came when we had this uh General way of measuring approximating productive effort which wasn't very good but whatever right I mean I want to see you're at the office and you're doing things the problem was the front office it Revolution right because I'm I'm essentially a techn Critic I see everything through the lens of technology in my writing we got computers we got networks we got email pseudo productivity can't be be sustainable in that context because now with something like email and then later tools like slack I can demonstrate effort at a very fine grain right because I can send an email respond to this jump onto a slack conversation I can now do that at a very fine grain level um and essentially everywhere and anywhere all throughout my day I can be demonstrating labor at home I can be demonstrating labor because we have mobile Computing we get the smartphone Revolution um so there there's now an ability to constantly be demonstrating effort at all points of our day and that's where I think the wheels came off the bus right and and led to this this this point that got worse and worse starting the early 2000s and hit ahead in the pandemic of knowledge worker burnout knowledge worker exhaustion and nihilism of like what's going on with my job like all I do is zoom all day what's happening I think that pseudo productivity plus front office it Revolution they did not play nice together and you can see this by the way if you look even at productivity books you see this huge shift that happens early 90s versus early 2000s it's like a completely shift in tone right early 90s it's stepen cvy is very optimistic it's like how are we going to self-actualize and like carefully choose the most meaningful activities to fulfill all of our dreams for all of our roles early 2000s now we have email you have David Allen that's like", "but I think one thing that we have not accounted for is the cost of these changes right if we know what the costs are of certain actions we may still take those actions but we may find ways to mitigate the the costs we may in this case invest more in our relationships be more conscious about reaching out to other people going to visit at them uh but that has been a a quiet but but devastating Consequence the other piece with modernity is that we have more convenience in our life which means that we also don't need to see other people to get certain things done like buying groceries or mailing an item out or getting something from the store I can sit in the comfort of my home and have everything just come to me now on the one hand that's incredibly efficient right but I think efficiency is an interesting thing because it's only one factor we should be considering in our lives there too we have to ask the cost and one interesting thing about Co is many people in the first year of Co when we were all separated from one another you know when we finally came back together again I had so many people who said to me you know what I expected to miss my parents and my siblings and my friends not being able to see them what I didn't expect was missing the strangers that I saw at the coffee shop or the folks who I ran into the grocery store or seeing neighbors as I walked down the street like I actually missed that more than I thought I would so we have lost out on some of those interactions and those loose ties but the final thing to keep in mind also is about what is happening with how we are using social media technology which I think is fundamentally transformed how we interact with one another and how we see ourselves and each other and this is particularly true for young people uh who are growing up as digital natives but what has happened there I worry is that and and it's not that social media is all bad just to be clear you know technology look I'm I'm a believer that in technology broadly speaking you know I'm a user of technology I spent seven years building a tech company I'm a Believer in Tech", "- Yeah, I think that, well, one, in terms of, you know, measuring your level of\nsophistication and intelligence when you say OMG, right.\n\nI think that also could\nbe a cultural thing that, ah, you belong\nto the next generation.\n\nIf you're an, you know, or you're being cool, if you're an older person, you know, using OMG and other\nthings that the, you know, younger generation would use.\n\nBut if I really think about it clearly, texting actually has allowed for more rapid communication\namongst people.\n\nI think, without the invention\nof the phone before then, or, you know, texting back and forth, you had to wait days\nfor a letter to show up.\n\nYou couldn't call somebody on the phone and talk as well, you know?\n\nAnd so this rapid communication in terms of the rapid communication\nof writing in this case.\n\nSo I think actually, it's more like a use it or lose it kind of a thing with the brain.\n\nThe more you use a particular\nbrain region or circuit, the more enhanced.\n\nIt's like a muscle.\n\nThe more you exercise it,\nthe more healthier it is, the bigger it becomes and\nthe more space it takes and the more you lose something else.", "but I think whether technology helps or hurts us is about how it's designed and ultimately about how it ends up being used and what we've seen with social media as well is that uh for many people it ended up leading to in-person connections being replaced with online connections um we came to somehow value and um almost seek out more and more followers and friends on social media feeling like somehow that made us more connected but the nature of dialogue also changed like as human beings we evolved over thousands of years to not just understand the words someone is saying but to hear the tone of their voice to see their facial expression like you and I are sitting across and and we're both processing like our body language right and I'm seeing you nod your head and I'm seeing your eyes focused like all of that matters to how we communicate um but also like you and I are less likely to say something hurtful right now to one another because we can see each other if I said something to hurtful to you like i' probably see the the pain or consternation on your face and that might give me pause right when you're communicating online with other people without any of that information or with any of the uh sort of barriers if you will that make you pause before you hurt someone it leads to a very different kind of communication uh one that can be quite hurtful at times", "uh so much is being lost because we're in the suboptimal Nash equilibrium everyone just email everyone all the time everyone's just on slack all the time that when we finally have the revolution to get over that it's going to be a massive economic hit and you know AI might play a role in this right because maybe AI once it gets planning capabilities is going to be able to take the burden of some of this back and forth planning I think it's easier to get there with cultural shifts I don't think we have to wait to build an email cap capable chat GPT to do this like you could solve this tomorrow this is cultural as much as it's tool based but I think it's going to be a huge Revolution when we get there Ain to uh like the assembly line in manufacturing which was like a 10x Improvement in productivity metrics when we figured out the continuous motion assembly line with interchangeable parts was a massive it created this uh productivity engine I'm using the economics s productivity now um you know dollars per worker uh the economic miracle that came from this process based industrial Innovations in the the late 19th early 20th century that the money generated by that the wealth generated by that was the foundation of the modern West like the whole world as we know it was built there's these huge latent potentials um and right now I don't think we're there with the brain and I think it's going to be a huge Revolution it's just it's just difficult right it's not an easy Revolution to start but I think it's going to change whole Industries in ways that we're it's going to be hard to even imagine"]

Answer: 

Several strategies can help reduce youth exposure to harmful online content:

1. Parental controls and oversight: Implementing robust parental controls allows parents to monitor and manage their children's online activities. This includes overseeing social media use and understanding what content their children are accessing.

2. Age restrictions and verification: Raising the minimum age for social media use to 16 and implementing strict age verification processes can significantly reduce young children's exposure to inappropriate content. This approach is being considered in some countries, like Britain.

3. Creating tech-free zones and times: Establishing specific times and places where technology use is prohibited, such as during meals, an hour before bedtime, and during family gatherings, can limit overall exposure and promote healthier habits.

4. Open dialogue between parents and children: Engaging in honest conversations about online experiences helps children understand what is unacceptable and encourages them to report concerning content or interactions.

5. Platform-provided tools: Social media companies are developing features to protect younger users. For instance, some platforms default to private experiences for users under 16, offer tools to block harassers, and provide nudges to diversify content consumption when users get stuck in potentially harmful loops.

6. Education and awareness: Teaching children about the potential risks of social media, how to identify harmful content, and strategies to protect themselves online is crucial. This includes understanding the impact of excessive use on mental health and well-being.

7. Legal and policy measures: Implementing safety standards similar to those in the automotive industry could help protect children from exposure to harmful content, bullying, and features designed to manipulate them into excessive use. Requiring data transparency from social media companies would also allow for better research and understanding of the platforms' impact on youth mental health.

It's important to note that while these strategies can be effective, the rapidly evolving nature of technology presents ongoing challenges. A comprehensive approach involving parents, educators, policymakers, and tech companies is necessary to create a safer online environment for youth.

Retrieved Contexts: ["but you're trying to understand their experience is important also so you can help them understand what is not acceptable for them to experience on social media if they're being harassed or bullied by strangers uh that is a problem you want your child to to tell you about that to report that um if they see something posted online that's really concerning to them let's say they see a friend post that they're thinking of taking their own life or harming themsel in another way you want them to know that that's important to flag and to get help you know that they shouldn't just you know scroll past that so that conversation is really important and finally as parents we can lead by example right and this is hard because the truth is we've been talking about social media and youth and that's what the subject of my search and General's advisory was on but I have concerns about adults too I said as somebody who's had challenges in my own use you know of social media finding sometimes it bleeds you know past my bedtime and I'm realized you know I think m&a checked something for 5 minutes an hour later I'm still there you know scrolling through something uh and sometimes I you know you know I find myself over the years I found myself comparing myself also to posts I see online and unhealthy ways sometimes I find myself um sort of pulled into uh content uh that uh you know ends up being angry and vitriolic and leaves me feeling worse you know at the end", "so you know it's just we somehow slipped into this and once you see it that way that it's as though our kids are being raised in hara's Casino you know like like no we've got to stop this last year I had the opportunity to speak to to some of the groups at these companies that are assigned to controlling the well-being of the young people that use their platforms and the major emphasis was on the type of content so protecting them against child Predators protecting them against pornography um but as you recall at the beginning of the conversation we broke things down into variables of time specific content Dynamics and maybe the visual interface itself I think for sake of today's discussion the visual interface is probably the least interesting but I can just tell you looking things up close uh a lot not good the eyeball lengthens you become nearsighted which is why spending two hours outside um even if on a tablet has been shown to offset myopia and oh wow thousands of people children anyway there's that piece but the time piece is interesting right maybe limiting the total amount of time on social media obviously the content issue is it only takes one exposure to a video of the sort that you described The Gauntlet I never want to see it whatever has to be done to my phone so that I never see it please uh let me know", "There are ways that\nit can be negative, in terms of bad interactions,\nthings like bullying, which we can talk about because\nthere's a lot that we've done to basically make sure that\npeople can be safe from that and give people tools and\ngive kids the ability to have the right parental controls.\n\nTheir parents can oversee that.\n\nBut that's the interacting\nwith people side.", "so I would protect that time hour before bed throughout the night I would also create make sure meal times uh were Tech free zone so that people actually that you talk to one another you see one another and time with friends and family members when you're out you know at a birthday party Etc make that Tech free time let them focus on their time with other people those three Tech free zones can do a world of good uh to help your child and then the last thing I'd recommend here the many things I think parents could do is to start a dialogue with your child about their use of social media um we don't always know how social media is making our kids feel uh from the and we may realize when we talk to them that they actually have their own concerns they might say yeah it's not making me feel really good but it's just like hard not to be on it everyone's like texting on this or everyone is uh you know everyone's you know sharing information and posting pictures on it I feel like I need to be on it you can only help them start to manage that if you know that that's a challenge that they're having so opening a conversation so your child knows that you're not judging them", "but we just need a norm now for for raising the age to 16 we can struggle to do that I'm doing that with my kids I'm saying no for my daughter no Snapchat till you're 16 16 um and she's the only one who doesn't have it it's painful for her and she's 14 um but my hope is that no parent again will be in that situation that in every school a lot of the parents are going to say no no social media till 16 now of course the laws currently state that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract give away your data and make a deal with a company without your parents knowledge or permission but Congress passed this terrible law in 1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy protection act it was supposed to set the age to 16 which is not which is I think pretty reasonable but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement it's the law is written such that as long as the company doesn't absolutely know that you're underage they're fine they're not responsible 13 they're motivated the companies are now the law motivates the companies to not know how old children are there's barely any forbrain at 13 that's right that's right and since all you have to do you just have to be old enough to lie about your age if you're old enough to lie about your age you can go anywhere on the internet because there's no enforcement so I'm saying let's take the age of 13 which is not enforced let's require age verification which is complicated but they're working on that in Britain they've they're mandating that it's going to happen in Britain we'll work out the technical details um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's the one place where I think we really do need law uh because social media is a social trap and if half the kids are on it there's going to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws", "So we work hard on all these\ndifferent problems-- making sure that we're helping connect\npeople as best as possible, helping make sure that\nwe give people good tools to block people who\nmight be bullying them, or harass them, or\nespecially for younger folks, anyone under the age of 16\ndefaults into an experience where their\nexperience is private.\n\nWe have all these\nparental tools.\n\nSo that way, parents can\nunderstand what their children are up to in a good balance.\n\nAnd then on the\nother side, we try to give people tools\nto understand how they're spending their time.\n\nWe try to give people tools\nso that if you're a teen and you're stuck in some\nloop of just looking at one type of content,\nwe'll nudge you and say, hey, you've been looking at content\nof this type for a while.\n\nHow about something else?\n\nAnd here's a bunch\nof other examples.\n\nSo I think that there\nare things that you can do to push this in\na positive direction.\n\nBut I think it just\nstarts with having a more nuanced view of this\nisn't all good or all bad.\n\nAnd the more that you\ncan make it a positive thing, the better this\nwill be for all the people who use our products.", "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", "so I think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here too cuz Andrew my big concern with parents is look we've taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which we didn't grow up with as kids and we've told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this um you know when we were growing up you remember the motor vehicle fatalities were really high uh in America and we didn't say okay you know what that's just the price of Modern Life we just have to accept it and keep moving on with our lives we said hold on we don't have to go back to horses and Buggies but we also don't need to accept this death rate we need to make this experience safer and so we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups like Matt and others across the country that me Mothers Against Drunk Driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts airbags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that help helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents and deaths and that's what we need here too like we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting in place safety standards to protect kids from exposure to harmful content from from the experience of bullying and harassment and that also protect them from features that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use uh which is happening far too often right now we also need a policy that requires data transparency from the company you know researchers tell us all the time that they these are independent researchers they tell us they are having a hard time getting full access to the data from the social media platforms about the full impact of the platforms on the mental health of kids and as a parent look I I don't when we bought car seats for my children when when they were born we looked up the safety data like many parents we wanted to make sure the car seats were safe but if you had told me that hey you know the manufacturers of these car seats are actually

Ground Truths: ['Strategies to reduce youth exposure to harmful online content include protecting them against child predators and pornography, limiting the total amount of time spent on social media, and being cautious about the type of content they are exposed to. Additionally, spending time outside has been shown to help offset issues like myopia, which can be exacerbated by excessive screen time.']

Answer: 

Promoting independence and adventure plays a crucial role in children's growth, especially in today's tech-driven world. This approach to child-rearing can have several positive impacts on kids' development:

1. Social skills development: Unstructured play time and independent activities allow children to learn how to negotiate situations with other kids, resolve conflicts, and collaborate. These experiences are essential for developing social skills that may be lacking in purely digital interactions.

2. Problem-solving abilities: When children are given the freedom to explore and have adventures, they encounter real-world challenges that require creative problem-solving. This contrasts with the more controlled and predictable environments often found in digital spaces.

3. Emotional resilience: Facing and overcoming challenges in the real world helps children build emotional resilience. This is particularly important in a tech-driven world where instant gratification is common, and difficulties can be easily avoided.

4. Physical health: Encouraging outdoor activities and adventures promotes physical activity, which is crucial for children's health and development, especially given the sedentary nature of many tech-based activities.

5. Memory formation and identity: Real-world experiences create lasting memories that contribute to a child's sense of self. As Dr. Jonathan Haidt points out, virtual adventures may not have the same impact on memory formation as real-life experiences.

6. Independence and self-reliance: Allowing children to have independent adventures, such as riding a bicycle around the neighborhood or exploring with friends, fosters a sense of autonomy and self-reliance that is crucial for their development into self-supervised adults.

7. Balanced technology use: By promoting real-world activities, parents can help create a healthier balance between technology use and other aspects of life, potentially mitigating some of the negative effects of excessive screen time.

8. Creativity and imagination: Real-world play and adventures often require more creativity and imagination compared to pre-programmed digital experiences, fostering these important skills in children.

To implement this approach in a tech-driven world, parents and educators can:

- Establish phone-free zones or times, such as during family activities or in schools
- Encourage outdoor play and exploration
- Provide opportunities for unstructured play time
- Support activities like summer camps or sports that limit phone use
- Gradually increase children's independence in safe, age-appropriate ways

By promoting independence and adventure, we can help children develop crucial life skills and experiences that complement and balance the digital aspects of modern life, ultimately contributing to their overall growth and well-being.

to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "I love what your mom did getting you guys outside um my parents did the same thing too like we I was very blessed to have two parents who didn't come you know they didn't have a lot of resources growing up they didn't come to this country with a lot of resources but the one of the greatest gifts they G gave us is that they loved us uncondition Al the other great gift that they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out", "look you guys actually you can see what this is doing to you you mostly agree that this is wasting your time it's garbage you you want to way out but you just feel like you can't there's such resignation um but look the cool kids over there they have flip phones and they're out like every day after school they're like you know they're doing stuff they're down at you know they're in the mall they're they're getting pizza they're you know building a fort uh you know whatever depending on the age um so I think the way out is to give kids an exciting childhood kids are so lonely now and and they they don't have much in the way of Adventure they don't have much in the way of Thrills um you know you know I live I live in New York City um you know I would start I would like bring my kids out to Coney Island when they were you know 9 10 years old bring them out and then I would just say I'm just going to sit here you guys run around you guys go have fun like I'm not going to be with you you know you know yeah there's a chance you'll get kidnapped or struck by lightning although lightning is more likely um so and then it you know and then it got once they were you know in more you know like like 13 now they can actually take the subway out to Coney Island with a friend so um that's cool", "um so I am I'm very very confident that childhood is going to look very different within two years I don't mean that it won't be seven-year-olds on phones but in the same way that we flipped on smoking we used to think it was okay to smoke in an airplane uh we used to think it was okay to smoke in restaurants it was okay to smoke everywhere we thought um and now we don't we don't think that anymore that took a long time to change but it did change I think because of the public disgust with seeing children just spending their childhood looking at a screen and because the public disgust with what we've heard about meta and and Tik Tok and a few of the other companies um I think within two years it's going to be widespread it'll be a norm that you just don't give kids social media in particular I mean iPads are complicated because you know you want kids you know to watch movies is okay stories are good I'm not saying the you know iPad is a terrible thing but um our attitudes about this are going to change radically um and I think the great majority of schools are going to be phone free within two years um and we're going to see we're already seeing more kids outside lot every day I get I get emails from Greatful parents saying you know because of your book me know my six-year-old he wanted to ride his bicycle down to the end of our cesac he wanted to ride down Circle and come back and I never would let him because I was afraid that what what would the neighbors say but once I read your book I decided to let him and he was so ecstatic he kept doing it and doing it and now he's going further and he rides to his friends houses so people in her neighborhood now they're seeing a kid on a bicycle and if Suppose there were 10 kids doing it well now it's normal so we can renormalize human childhood in the real world where our kids get the chance to have independent adventures and learn how to be self-supervised adults ultimately we can do this okay", "most Instagram no so it the the huge time suck is the videos so it's actually Tik Tok and YouTube are counted in this analysis they're counted as social media YouTube is marginally social media it's more of an general information Source but the point is especially the short videos the short videos are really really addictive because the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the house every day to go play my mom would say get out of the house I now realize she wanted space yeah", "as young kids like we're given all the things that are going to drive our sensory World um in the appropriate ways top watch and sound and um we're trying to build meaning in our

actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the reason why I got this far is because it's a set of collective action traps everyone every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone so the four recommendations I have are four ways of breaking out on the Trap but the first two are really about delaying and getting past this period of plasticity and you really help me see why it's so urgent to delay until late puberty at least so here are the four Norms that I think can break us out of this trap Norm number one uh no smartphone before high school you can give your kid a flip phone flip the Millennials had flip phones they came out fine no access or no smartphone of their own your own you can't have your own and that would even go for an iPad if you give your kid an iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it any you know anywhere in the house and you can take it outside even although maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the point is um the internet is an amazing thing and you know you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids and they can do things on the computer but you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to so it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone let them have a flip phone or a simple phone watch something like that that's rule number one rule number two is the most relevant for what we're just talking about and that is no social media until 16 there is I believe

Answer: 

Dopamine spikes and compulsive behaviors have significant impacts on emotional well-being and self-awareness. These impacts can be both positive and negative, depending on the context and frequency of the behaviors.

Dopamine is a powerful molecule that plays a crucial role in motivation, pleasure, and reward-seeking behavior. When we engage in activities that cause dopamine spikes, such as consuming certain foods, using social media, or engaging in addictive behaviors, it can create a sense of excitement and pleasure. However, this can lead to a progressive narrowing of the things that bring us pleasure, which is a hallmark of addiction.

The relationship between dopamine spikes and emotional well-being is complex. While initial dopamine releases can create feelings of excitement and happiness, repeated spikes can lead to a lowering of our baseline dopamine levels. This can result in a state where we find it increasingly difficult to derive pleasure from everyday activities, potentially leading to feelings of dissatisfaction or even depression.

Compulsive behaviors driven by dopamine spikes can also impact our self-awareness. As we become more focused on seeking out these dopamine-releasing activities, our attention narrows, making it harder to maintain a broader perspective on our lives and behaviors. This can lead to a cycle where we become less aware of the negative impacts of our actions and more focused on the immediate gratification they provide.

The impact on self-awareness is particularly evident in addictive behaviors. As Dr. Anna Lembke explains, addiction can be seen as a progressive narrowing of the things that bring us pleasure, while a good life is characterized by a progressive expansion of pleasurable activities. This narrowing of focus can significantly reduce our self-awareness and ability to engage in a diverse range of life experiences.

However, it's important to note that dopamine is not inherently negative. It's crucial for motivation, movement, and many aspects of a fulfilling life. The key lies in maintaining a healthy balance and understanding how to leverage dopamine effectively.

To mitigate the negative impacts of dopamine spikes and compulsive behaviors on emotional well-being and self-awareness, strategies such as dopamine fasting, binding behaviors, and developing a broader range of rewarding activities can be helpful. These approaches can help reset dopamine baselines and expand our sources of pleasure and satisfaction.

In conclusion, while dopamine spikes and compulsive behaviors can provide short-term pleasure, their long-term impact on emotional well-being and self-awareness can be detrimental if not managed properly. Understanding and consciously regulating our dopamine system is crucial for maintaining a balanced, satisfying, and self-aware life.

40 day detox, it's like a dopamine fast, - Right.\n\n- right, okay.\n\nFirst 10 days are miserable.\n\nMiddle 10 days, the clouds are out, there may be some shards\nof sunlight coming through.\n\nAnd then all of a sudden\nsun starts to come out, it gets brighter and brighter.\n\nWhy is it then that people will relapse, not just after getting fired from a job or their spouse leaving them, but when

don't want to reveal any more than that.\n\nAnd relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity to\ncreate for the entire world.\n\nAnd I was like how can that happen?\n\nBut now I'm

evidence to\nsuggest that that may be true.\n\nThe other thing that we know, and this is really kind\nof what the book is about, is that if we expose ourselves chronically to substances or behaviors

excitement.\n\nOkay?\n\nI'm using a broad brush here, but essentially what you\nneed to know is that, dopamine and epinephrin aka\nadrenaline are family members.\n\nAnd they tend to work\ntogether like a little gang to make you seek out certain things.\n\nSo what sorts of activities?\n\nWhat sorts of things increase dopamine?\n\nAnd how much do they increase dopamine?\n\nWell, let's take a look\nat some typical things that people do out there\nor ingest out there that are known to increase dopamine.\n\nSo let's recall that you have\na baseline level of dopamine and that everybody does.\n\nAnd even within a family, you might have family members\nwho are very excitable, happy and motivated, and others who are less\nexcitable, happy and motivated.\n\nBut your level of dopamine

homeostasis is.\n\nSocial homeostasis, just like hunger, is the process by which when\nyou lack social interaction, you start to crave it.\n\nWhat's very interesting about the fact that there are dopamine\nneurons in this raphe structure that is the effector\nfor social homeostasis, what this means is that\nwhen you are not interacting with people at a frequency or intensity, that is right for you, dopamine is released into the brain.\n\nIn most popular\nconversations about dopamine, and even in scientific circles, when you hear dopamine release, you think about reward or feeling good, because indeed many behaviors and drugs of abuse increase dopamine.\n\nThat's one of the reasons they have so much addictive potential.\n\nHowever, dopamine is not\nassociated with feeling good, it is actually the neurochemical that's responsible for movement toward things that feel good.", "well then we consider it adaptive if it's not well then considered maladaptive some people will sit down to play a video game they really like video games and as they're sitting down they will experience a five-fold increase in the rate of dopamine output from their nucleus accumbens for other people it's going to be a tenfold increase for other people like me who don't like video games very much I don't have anything against them I don't dislike them but it doesn't do much for me it might not cause any increase whatsoever it might even cause a decrease in dopamine so there's a lot of individual variability for sex it turns out to be a range so the typical range that's cited in the literature is anywhere from a four to five-fold increase in the rate of dopamine neuron firing however there are certain individuals for which that number is doubled caffeine is a little bit of a special circumstance because caffeine has the property of not just causing the release of dopamine but increasing the amount of dopamine receptors over time and there aren't a lot of excellent measurements of the amount of dopamine released as a function of caffeine intake in different populations of humans it's mostly animal studies but what we think based on the Gestalt based on the overall picture of the literature is that it's an approximate doubling of the dopamine signaling that's coming out of the VTA nucleus accumens to prefrontal Cortex when we anticipate and when we drink our coffee again I really want to be clear that for all of these things these are relative levels and they are distribution so if we were to plot them out on paper you would see that these are not bar graphs these are overlapping curves to some extent so some people are going to achieve more dopamine release or less dopamine release from one Behavior or substance however it's very clear that cocaine methamphetamine even heroin for that matter are way out on the right hand side of the curve causing enormous increases in dopamine very quickly and the other things that we described have again a distribution that is more leftward shifted on this imaginary plot that I'm creating it's a lot of individual variability however it's fascinating that dopamine is the single molecule that's causing the craving and pursuit and experience of all of these substances and behaviors and the learning of all of that craving Pursuit and actual experience is what predicts whether or not we will re-engage reuse that substance or not re-engage in a behavior or not and how frequently we will do that so that's addiction but if you understand how the height of those peaks in dopamine and the rate to reach those Peaks and the troughs that result and how long the troughs take to get back to Baseline if you understand or a little or all of that you're really in a terrific position to understand how to Leverage The dopamine system for the pursuit of healthy goals and behaviors I should mention one thing about recovery from addiction which is that the reset of all that dopamine circuitry from unhealthy to healthy often involves depending on the addiction 30 days of complete abstinence that 30 days of complete abstinence inevitably involves a lot of pain and discomfort and craving anxiety insomnia Etc that relates to the big trough in dopamine that inevitably occurs now of course there are some addictions such as severe alcohol addiction and in some cases opiate addiction that immediate and sustained abstinence cannot be used as the tool somebody really needs to work with an addiction specialist and sometimes there needs to be a tapering off of the substance for other addictions it can be quote unquote cold turkey and then of course there are other addictions particularly food and sex but sometimes even things like video games for which the desired outcome is not necessarily to eliminate the behavior completely but to set some constraints around the behavior so that it's not occurring to the exclusion of other pleasureful things in life and adaptive things in life and for that there is the requirement for what are called binding behaviors we'll get back to binding behaviors later but binding behaviors or behaviors in which people bind their behavior around a particular substance use or around a particular behavioral addiction like sex Video Games Etc in space and or time in space meaning they might only engage in those particular behaviors in certain places and certain times when it's context appropriate there are numerous examples of binding behaviors in space and time it all has to do with clamping or directing when the engagement with the dopamine releasing behavior is going to occur so what's happening when people decide to go cold turkey or they use these binding behaviors well what's happening is that people are engaging the specific circuitry within the prefrontal cortex that as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode are important for context setting so in the cases of binding behaviors the prefrontal cortex is essentially getting trained up to understand that okay certain things like food or perhaps sex or perhaps video games they're okay if they are done or consumed in appropriate amounts or in particular context that requires the context setting goal directed behavior that the prefrontal cortex is responsible", 'But if you understand the\nway that dopamine works, what you\'ll realize is that\nwhen this dopamine pathway is triggered, it tends to create not the\nsensation or the perception of satiety, of feeling\nlike something is enough, but rather to produce the\nsensation of wanting more.\n\nAs described in the episode that I hosted with my phenomenal colleague from Stanford School of\nMedicine, Dr. Anna Lembke, she\'s an expert on addiction\nand dopamine pathways, the dopamine circuits of the brain have what we call a pleasure pain balance.\n\nAnd there I\'m paraphrasing\nwhat Dr. Anna Lembke has said, and has written about\nin her beautiful book, "Dopamine Nation."\n\nIf you haven\'t read that\nbook, I highly recommend it.\n\nWhether or not you have\nissues with addiction or you know people that do, or you don\'t, it\'s an incredibly important read, especially if you\'re\ninterested in understanding motivated behaviors and ways\nto channel your behaviors in life toward healthy,\nmotivated behaviors, and make sure that you avoid\nsome of the common pitfalls that people fall into, not just addiction, but things like overuse of social media or wasting time in general,\nit\'s a phenomenal book.']

Ground Truths: ['Dopamine spikes and compulsive behaviors can lead to feelings of shame, loneliness, and anxiety. Individuals may engage in addictive activities, such as gambling or excessive use of social media, to self-medicate, but this often results in a lack of emotional satisfaction and awareness. The compulsive nature of these behaviors can prevent individuals from recognizing their true feelings and needs, leading to a diminished sense of well-being.']

Answer: 

From a neurobiological perspective, the issues related to boys and their mental health are closely tied to the neural circuits associated with sex and violence. These circuits have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years and are particularly heightened in boys.

In the modern context, these neural circuits are being stimulated in extreme ways. For example, boys are exposed to increasingly intense pornographic content, which has evolved from relatively tame material like Playboy magazines to hardcore content featuring extreme acts. Similarly, violent video games provide a potent stimulus for these circuits.

The neurobiologist's view suggests that these modern stimuli act as "super stimuli" for the male brain, similar to how junk food acts as a super stimulus for our taste receptors. This overstimulation can lead to a sort of "dopamine bath," potentially trapping boys in cycles of seeking these intense experiences.

It's important to note that while girls are experiencing higher rates of depression and suicide attempts, boys still have a much higher suicide completion rate. This is partly due to boys tending to use more violent means when attempting suicide.

The neurobiological perspective also highlights the role of hormones in brain development. Testosterone, which is converted to estrogen in the brain, plays a crucial role in organizing the "male" brain during development. This process is complex and involves counterintuitive biological flips, challenging simplistic notions of how sex hormones influence brain development.

In comparison to girls, whose mental health issues often manifest as anxiety, depression, and self-criticism, boys' issues seem to be more externally directed, potentially due to these heightened neural circuits related to sex and violence.

This neurobiological view provides insight into why boys might be particularly vulnerable to certain types of mental health issues in the modern digital age, where super stimuli are readily available and can potentially hijack these evolved neural circuits.

the Nuance here because um you're telling me that girls are killing themselves more they're depressed their increase in suicide is larger boys have a much higher suicide rate so boy many more boys die from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or a bridge whereas girls tend to use pills or cutting their wrists and they and the great majority of girl suicide attempts don't lead to death yeah so are most of the issues with girls and online use social

specific what is happening to the brain during puberty that would be relevant here to a sensitive period okay so this goes back to the biology that you accurately described earlier which is that while we're in utero if there's a y chromosome then a bunch of genes are made like mulian an inhibiting hormone the malarian ducts become inhibited um the testes grow then testosterone is secreted and testosterone and some of its derivatives like dihydro testosterone organize the brain quote unquote male this is dangerous language nowadays but it's less dangerous now than it was two years ago okay

sense of Duty and how they're supposed to be in the world um I would think just the way I just laid out the little you know by all admittance like just very Antiquated now view of maleness um that they would be thinking a lot about what's going on it would meet some of the daily practices that you talked about earlier um that there would be reflection that there would be um Consciousness there would be um uh an understanding of one's Shadow or if one were to add in the the other stereotype that went with it that they drink a lot right that was very much I'll remember my first I went to graduate school first at Berkeley before I shifted to a different place um and I was told when I got there that it used to be that the faculty and graduate students of which at that time in the 1970s and 60s was mostly male mostly now that's changed fortunately right that they would meet every day after work to drink and then stagger home to their Partners every day and I was shocked like are you kidding me I was like no every single day so you know the the idea here is that um that was the old view now things are very different but what about the work of men men and boys to try and understand their own psyche better what what is the uh what are the things that are specific to them that you've talked about and then we'll turn to women and then uh we'll we'll do our best to bridge The Divide

over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating

Answer: 

The anxiety and depression statistics reveal a concerning trend in mental health among girls since the 1970s. From the 1990s through 2010-2011, the rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm among girls were relatively stable and low. During this period, approximately 12-15% of girls qualified as having had a major depression, which was considered problematic but manageable.

However, a dramatic shift occurred around 2012. The statistics for girls show a sharp uptick, often described as a "hockey stick" pattern on graphs. This sudden increase was not subtle; it was as if someone had "turned on a light switch" in 2012. The rise in mental health issues for girls was steep and significant, with most measures showing increases in the range of 50% to 150%. In many cases, the rates nearly doubled, especially for younger girls.

This trend is not limited to self-reported data. Similar patterns are observed in hospital admissions for self-harm and psychiatric emergency department visits. Importantly, this phenomenon is not unique to one country but is seen across the developed world, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavian countries.

In contrast, while boys also experienced increases in depression and anxiety, their trend line was different. For boys, the increase began earlier, around 2009-2010, and showed a more gradual, continuous rise rather than the sharp uptick seen in girls.

It's worth noting that these statistics represent a significant departure from historical trends. The suddenness and magnitude of the change, particularly for girls, suggest that something fundamental shifted in the early 2010s that had a disproportionate impact on girls' mental health across multiple developed nations.

that's for the American data um internationally you see very similar things it's not necessarily 2012 in other countries but the girls graphs are very sharp the boys are also up on depression anxiety they're also way up depending on the measure it's usually everything is in the ballpark of 50 to 150% almost all the numbers are in that range um we're not talking 10 or 20% increases here for most things we're talking close to a doubling especially for the younger girls the boys curves interestingly are smoother that is the boys are more depressed and anxious it's but it's not 2012 it it actually often begins begins more like 2009 2010 and then it just keeps going up gradually so that that's a real clue um which we'll come back when we talk about the the boy story um it a lot of people say oh you know it's just self-report um you know just gen Z they're really they're really um positive about mental health and they're willing to talk about it's a good thing", "so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had

boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or a bridge whereas girls tend to use pills or cutting their wrists and they and the great majority of girl suicide attempts don't lead to death yeah so are

Answer: 

Prioritizing experiences over deprivation is crucial for children's development as it fosters healthy emotional growth, cognitive abilities, and social skills. This approach recognizes that children thrive when exposed to a variety of positive and enriching experiences, rather than simply avoiding negative ones.

One significant aspect is the role of play and unstructured time. Unstructured play allows children to explore, be creative, and develop problem-solving skills. It also provides opportunities for social interaction, which is essential for emotional development and learning to form bonds with others. Unfortunately, there's a growing trend of over-structuring children's lives, which can limit these crucial developmental experiences.

Positive experiences during childhood have a profound impact on neural circuits and behavior. When children engage in enjoyable activities or receive positive reinforcement, it strengthens the neural pathways associated with those behaviors, making it more likely for them to repeat them in the future. This process is particularly important during puberty and adolescence when children are exploring autonomy and making assessments about how different experiences make them feel internally.

Emotional regulation is another key area influenced by childhood experiences. Children who are exposed to a range of emotions and learn how to manage them effectively are better equipped to handle stress and maintain healthy relationships as adults. This includes understanding both excitement (dopamine-driven) and contentment (serotonin-driven) states.

The significance of prioritizing experiences extends beyond childhood and into adulthood. Our entire lifespan is a developmental arc, and the experiences we have as children shape how we interact with others, regulate our emotions, and approach new situations throughout our lives. For instance, children who have positive social interactions and learn to form secure attachments are more likely to have healthy adult relationships.

It's important to note that while traumatic or highly stressful experiences can make it harder for children to engage in play and access neuroplasticity later in life, this effect is not permanent. With appropriate interventions and support, these challenges can be overcome.

In summary, prioritizing experiences over deprivation is significant because it promotes holistic development, enhances neural plasticity, fosters emotional regulation, and sets the foundation for lifelong learning and healthy relationships.

responded to our\nacts of anxiety essentially.\n\nNow this isn\'t Freudian theory, There are components of it that are embedded in Freudian theory, but all developmental\npsychologists agree that babies lack the ability to make cognitive sense\nof the outside world, but in this feeling of anxiety and registering one\'s own internal state, and then crying out to the outside world, either through crying\nor subtle vocalizations, or even just cuing, making some noise, we start to develop a relationship\nwith the outside world in which our internal states, our shifts and anxiety\nstart to drive requests, and people come and respond\nto those requests, hopefully.\n\nAnd the reason I say hopefully is that we\'ve all heard presumably about these cases of neglect.\n\nThere are a lot of cases\nwhere if you neglect a baby, you neglect an adolescent or a teenager, development doesn\'t go well, and we\'ll touch on some of those.\n\nBut those are really extreme cases.\n\nThey\'re sort of like the\nparallel to experiments that are often done in the\nlaboratory with animals, where you\'ve probably heard\nof these enriched environments where they\'ll give mice a bunch of toys, and they\'ll give them some different foods\nevery once in a while, and they\'ll house them\ntogether with other mice.\n\nAnd then what you find\nis that the animals, they will say, "Oh, their brain is thicker and their neurons have more\nbranches to them and all that."', 'But that\'s really comparing\ndeprivation with normalcy.\n\nWhat we want to center on today instead is what happens when things go well, and why things might not go well in certain circumstances is interesting.\n\nBut to me, not as interesting as what healthy emotional\ndevelopment looks like.\n\nAnd if you haven\'t achieved\nhealthy emotional development, what can be done as an intervention at later times in order to rescue that?\n\nSo the baby, you as a baby, you\'re flopping around there in your crib, you\'re getting care where you need it and when you need it, presumably, and this gets to the basis\nof what emotions are about, which are emotions are\nreally about forming bonds and being able to predict\nthings in the world.\n\nThat\'s really what emotions are about.\n\nWhether or not the baby\nfeels angry or happy or sad, we don\'t know, we can\nguess, but we don\'t know.\n\nIn fact, most of the time we\ndon\'t even know how we feel, let alone how other people feel, and that\'s true for adults.\n\nSo if I asked you how you feel right now, I don\'t know that you could tell me in any kind of rich\nlanguage that I would say, "Oh I really understand."', "- Your child real, real child.\n\nThe real kind of experiment.\n\n- It's how do I resist the urge to force my child to eat her dinner so that she can have her dessert, right?\n\nBecause that's the real urge.\n\nIt's like, no, you need\n- Or you're negotiating.\n\n- to do that.\n\nBecause when you start thinking about it in terms of mindset, you realize, oh, that's just reinforcing to her, that the dessert is the\nexciting, fun thing to have.\n\nAnd this thing that I have\nto do must be horrible.\n\nSo horrible that my parent is\nforcing me to do it, right?\n\nSo it's letting go a\nlittle bit of the behavior, the objective reality, and really thinking about\nthe subjective reality and focusing on adaptive mindsets.\n\nSo my goal as a parent has been to try to help her\ninstill a healthy mindset about eating, that healthy foods are\nindulgent and delicious.\n\nThat the experience of\nstress is inevitable, that it's natural.\n\nAnd that going through\nstressful experience can help her learn, grow, and become a more connected\nand happier individual.\n\nAnd with exercise and physical activity, we haven't really gotten to that yet, but [laughs] we will with time.", "yeah so I think it's it's really I mean I'm I'm so I'm a parent I have two kids that are in public school and I think their Public Schools rated you know it's fine Buton say it's all right and um but but at their school they definitely do get education about um more holistic health and emotional regulation I think and and considering others um that's been that's that's a big focus of the school and I think that's actually really important I I I I mean you know again I'm I'm super biased from from my upbringing but my kids are going to learn math whenever it's time to learn the that they'll learn it whenever they need it you know whenever they need it they're going to learn it in a couple I don't know a couple weeks and figure out do the thing um most of the things that they learn they're going to forget them and then have to relearn them um so what are the things that you're going to really need to know no matter what you choose to do and I think regulating your your own emotions and and and engaging other individuals in a healthy sustainable way that you know and I mean sustainable in terms of the longevity of their relationships and I think those are the things that end up really mattering so I think um also this question about exposure to abundance and scarcity uh is really interesting too I mean I don't know if that's a direction we want to go into so please yeah well I think you know this whole you know it sort sounds sort of new Agy when I say you know abundant the abundance mindset", "Leveraging different kinds\nof social relationships that reinforce positive behavior.\n\nThis is starting to sound like\nkind of a boiler plate stuff.\n\nAnd yet, really the goal is during puberty to encourage as many\nsafe forms of interaction that allow children, teens,\nreally and adolescents, I keep calling them children, but what I mean are children\ngoing through puberty, that allow them to test\nthis thing of autonomy so that they can start\nto make good assessments about their exteroceptive\nevents that they are selecting and how those make them feel internally.\n\nSo they're essentially doing a buffet.\n\nThe buffet has now broadened to not just include the\nevents and experiences that their parents and\nother caretakers bring them, but they can now expand the buffet into things that they\ncan provide themselves.\n\nAnd so adolescence and puberty is really seen as the\nperiod of development in which one self-samples\nfor these two elements that we talked about at\nthe beginning, which are, how do I form bonds and how do I make predictions about what will make me feel good at a level of interoception.", "It's very apparent that\nhealthy social bonding between children and caretaker relies on the fact that\nboth this right brain system and the left brain system are engaged, that there's a synchronization\nof autonomic function, meaning a joining together\nin actual somatic feeling, and that there's a\nsynchronization of experience that's more about some\noutward or external stimulus, like reading a book or\nwatching a show together or enjoying some common\nexperience of a meal together.\n\nAnd of course, as children get older, they're able to access\nmore and more cognitively sophisticated things.\n\nYou can watch a movie with them and they'll make predictions\nabout which characters are going to show up for instance, or you can take to a concert and they can appreciate the\nconcert or play in that concert, and they appreciate that\nthey're being appreciated.", '- It reminds me, as a neurobiologist, was weaned in the landscape\nof so-called critical periods, where early life environment\nvery strongly shapes the brain.\n\nAnd so many studies were\ndone on animals raised in traditional cages with a\nwater bottle and some food, maybe a few other animals\nof the same species.\n\nAnd then people came along and said, wait, normally these species in\nthe wild would have things like things to climb over\nand things to go through, and you provide those very basic elements, and all of a sudden the\narchitecture of neural circuits looks very different, and you realize that were studying a deprived condition.', "One of my favorite things\nabout developmental biology and developmental psychology is that it is grounded in the fact that we don't just have a\nchildhood and an adulthood.\n\nThere isn't just our child\nself and our adult self.\n\nAnd even though there\nare transitions around the mechanisms that\nunderline neuroplasticity at approximately age 25, it is simply the case that development is our entire lifespan, that our lifespan is one\nlong developmental arc.\n\nHow long depends on our\ngenetics, our lifestyle accidents, injury and disease of course, but it is one long developmental arc.\n\nAnd so it shouldn't surprise us at all that how we learn to play as\na 10 year old or 12 year old would impact how we play\nand interact with people as a teenager and a young adult and on and on and on.\n\nAnd that play is the\nplace in which we explore in which we learn play is the substrate by which our nervous system changes us from this hyper-connected\nbatch of neurons, where everything is\nconnected to everything, more or less to a brain and nervous system whereby certain circuits work\nwith immense proficiency and others are less accessible to us.", "And there's a beautiful model of emotional development\nthat was developed by Alan shore professor at UCLA and psychiatrist that talks\nabout some of the basics of good infant parent attachment where good parenting that leads to healthy adult relationships and emotion regulation\ntends to include both sides of this dopamine serotonin spectrum.\n\nWe talk about the\nrelationship between child and parent typically was\nthe mother, but also father where you can get the child really excited by kind of squealing and ramping them up or talking about something\nor ice cream or play.\n\nAnd the kid gets very excited.\n\nThat's the dopaminergic system the anticipation of something\nthat's coming, but as well engaging with children\nin a way that's really about everything that you have right in the here and now,\nthe reading of the book the kids always seem to ask one more time.\n\nOne more.\n\nThey seem to want more of\nthe things that they enjoy but really engaging with them in a way that increases\ntheir sense of pleasure for what's right there, as\nwell as giving them a lot of things to be excited about\nand positive anticipation.", "but I worry that right now that we've almost somehow made that kind of unstructured time seem inefficient you know we've set these standards uh for our kids that they need to be uh you know getting fancy jobs and into fancy colleges and making an x amount of money and the path to doing that is you know to be enrolled in X number of activities after school and to do all this stuff in school and their lives are so hyper structured um that I worry that the time to just play to be creative to reflect and think to just have unstructured time with other kids has evaporated and I think that that also is hurting the mental health and wellbeing of our children I love the idea that that unstructured play time could be framed in the accurate context of the nervous system developing the way it was supposed to develop I mean I would argue that um success is going to be easiest for children that engage in the real world more in fact there's great risk to posting everything that you do online we've seen some examples of that preventing people from getting into or staying in college based on things they said or did previously that they shouldn't have said or done um that's those are kind of you know negative highlighted cases but in general um we know that the the nervous system thrives on diversity of types of interactions and social interactions in particular I'm just restating what you just said", "oh my goodness there's there's abundance here of something oh time to learn something new that's right we've we've overemphasized the extent to which plasticity is driven by punishment but the the neuromodulators that allow for plasticity in particular in puberty and as adults are largely dopamine dependent and acetylcholine dependent um the acetylcholine generally increases Focus um broadly speaking I mean does a bunch of other things controls muscular contraction Etc but so what we're basically saying here is that if a kid gets a strongly reinforcing experience I I'd be willing to bet both arms that the neural circuits that help generate whatever behaviors led to that experience are going to be strengthened in one trial to the extent that it will be very easy to generate those those behaviors again okay so this okay thank you this is exactly what I wanted to know to to deepen my the theorizing that I do in the book um so now this is actually the perfect time for us to switch over to the four recommendation the four main recommendations because they build exactly on what you just said they help me explain why this is so important so um so you know I think one one reason why the book seems to be doing very well and people seem to like and pass it on is that it's not just Doom and Gloom it's not just oh we've messed up our kids", "Now, one of the key findings that\nhas emerged from the literature is children that have\nbeen subjected to trauma or immense amounts of stress of any kind, have a harder time both engaging in play, but also a harder time\naccessing neuroplasticity later in life.\n\nThe good news is this is\nnot a permanent effect.\n\nAnd we'll talk about some\nof the ways to overcome that in a moment, but this should make sense to you because earlier we talked about how a high level of adrenaline epinephrine in the brain and body actually inhibits blocks the circuits in the brain and body that\ngenerate play behavior.\n\nAnd when I say that, I mean that in a very concrete way, that epinephrine and adrenaline can actually suppress\nthe sorts of circuitry that can lead to things like soft eyes or tongue out, or the head tilt, or what we called partial postures of being able to engage in, you know, a rough and tumble play, but not take that to the\npoint of outright aggression and damaging the other\nperson or them damaging you."]

Answer: 

Several measures are being emphasized for content protection to ensure the well-being of young people using social media platforms:

1. Age restrictions and verification:
There's a push to raise the minimum age for social media use from 13 to 16. Some experts argue for mandating age verification to enforce these restrictions more effectively.

2. Privacy settings:
Platforms are implementing default privacy settings for users under 16, ensuring their experience is more protected from the start.

3. Parental controls:
Social media companies are developing tools that allow parents to monitor and manage their children's online activities, striking a balance between safety and independence.

4. Content moderation:
Efforts are being made to protect young users from exposure to harmful content, including measures against child predators and inappropriate material.

5. Anti-bullying tools:
Platforms are providing users with options to block individuals who may be bullying or harassing them.

6. Time management features:
Companies are implementing tools to help users, especially teens, understand and manage their time spent on social media. This includes features that nudge users to take breaks or explore different types of content after extended periods of use.

7. Mental health considerations:
There's an increased focus on how social media affects mental health, with efforts to reduce negative impacts on body image and self-esteem.

8. Data transparency:
There are calls for social media companies to be more transparent with their data, allowing independent researchers to study the full impact of these platforms on young people's mental health.

9. User empowerment:
Platforms are working to educate young users about what is and isn't acceptable behavior online, encouraging them to report concerning content or interactions.

Despite these measures, challenges remain. Critics argue that the current self-regulation by companies is insufficient, and there are calls for more robust government policies and safety standards. Additionally, the burden of managing social media use often falls heavily on parents and children themselves, leading to suggestions for more systemic solutions.

It's important to note that while these measures are being emphasized, their effectiveness and implementation vary across platforms and continue to be subjects of ongoing debate and research.

the people who use our products.", "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", "but we just need a norm now for for raising the age to 16 we can struggle to do that I'm doing that with my kids I'm saying no for my daughter no Snapchat till you're 16 16 um and she's the only one who doesn't have it it's painful for her and she's 14 um but my hope is that no parent again will be in that situation that in every school a lot of the parents are going to say no no social media till 16 now of course the laws currently state that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract give away your data and make a deal with a company without your parents knowledge or permission but Congress passed this terrible law in 1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy protection act it was supposed to set the age to 16 which is not which is I think pretty reasonable but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement it's the law is written such that as long as the company doesn't absolutely know that you're underage they're fine they're not responsible 13 they're motivated the companies are now the law motivates the companies to not know how old children are there's barely any forbrain at 13 that's right that's right and since all you have to do you just have to be old enough to lie about your age if you're old enough to lie about your age you can go anywhere on the internet because there's no enforcement so I'm saying let's take the age of 13 which is not enforced let's require age verification which is complicated but they're working on that in Britain they've they're mandating that it's going to happen in Britain we'll work out the technical details um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's the one place where I think we really do need law uh because social media is a social trap and if half the kids are on it there's going to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws", "so I think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here too cuz Andrew my big concern with parents is look we've taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which we didn't grow up with as kids and we've told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this um you know when we were growing up you remember the motor vehicle fatalities were really high uh in America and we didn't say okay you know what that's just the price of Modern Life we just have to accept it and keep moving on with our lives we said hold on we don't have to go back to horses and Buggies but we also don't need to accept this death rate we need to make this experience safer and so we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups like Matt and others across the country that me Mothers Against Drunk Driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts airbags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that help helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents and deaths and that's what we need here too like we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting in place safety standards to protect kids from exposure to harmful content from from the experience of bullying and harassment and that also protect them from features that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use uh which is happening far too often right now we also need a policy that requires data transparency from the company you know researchers tell us all the time that they these are independent researchers they tell us they are having a hard time getting full access to the data from the social media platforms about the full impact of the platforms on the mental health of kids and as a parent look I I don't when we bought car seats for my children when when they were born we looked up the safety data like many parents we wanted to make sure the car seats were safe but if you had told me that hey you know the manufacturers of these car seats are actually not disclosing some of the the data on the impact on children uh but go ahead and buy it anyway", "but you're trying to understand their experience is important also so you can help them understand what is not acceptable for them to experience on social media if they're being harassed or bullied by strangers uh that is a problem you want your child to to tell you about that to report that um if they see something posted online that's really concerning to them let's say they see a friend post that they're thinking of taking their own life or harming themsel in another way you want them to know that that's important to flag and to get help you know that they shouldn't just you know scroll past that so that conversation is really important and finally as parents we can lead by example right and this is hard because the truth is we've been talking about social media and youth and that's what the subject of my search and General's advisory was on but I have concerns about adults too I said as somebody who's had challenges in my own use you know of social media finding sometimes it bleeds you know past my bedtime and I'm realized you know I think m&a checked something for 5 minutes an hour later I'm still there you know scrolling through something uh and sometimes I you know you know I find myself over the years I found myself comparing myself also to posts I see online and unhealthy ways sometimes I find myself um sort of pulled into uh content uh that uh you know ends up being angry and vitriolic and leaves me feeling worse you know at the end", "so you know it's just we somehow slipped into this and once you see it that way that it's as though our kids are being raised in hara's Casino you know like like no we've got to stop this last year I had the opportunity to speak to to some of the groups at these companies that are assigned to controlling the well-being of the young people that use their platforms and the major emphasis was on the type of content so protecting them against child Predators protecting them against pornography um but as you recall at the beginning of the conversation we broke things down into variables of time specific content Dynamics and maybe the visual interface itself I think for sake of today's discussion the visual interface is probably the least interesting but I can just tell you looking things up close uh a lot not good the eyeball lengthens you become nearsighted which is why spending two hours outside um even if on a tablet has been shown to offset myopia and oh wow thousands of people children anyway there's that piece but the time piece is interesting right maybe limiting the total amount of time on social media obviously the content issue is it only takes one exposure to a video of the sort that you described The Gauntlet I never want to see it whatever has to be done to my phone so that I never see it please uh let me know", "There are ways that\nit can be negative, in terms of bad interactions,\nthings like bullying, which we can talk about because\nthere's a lot that we've done to basically make sure that\npeople can be safe from that and give people tools and\ngive kids the ability to have the right parental controls.\n\nTheir parents can oversee that.\n\nBut that's the interacting\nwith people side.", "well not so much Facebook what if it's Tik Tok these companies these are the some of the largest and most powerful companies in the world they essentially own our children's childhood this is where childhood is taking place on a few giant PL for-profit platforms who that use an Advertising based business model so they are motivated like the Cino to keep them in don't have a clock don't let them see what time it is keep them in don't let them click over to a link to another site keep them in um we somehow have seeded our children's childhood to Giant companies that have shown that they don't really care about our kids welfare they care much more about profitability and and they care about their customers who are the advertisers and these companies have been granted a special RIT from the King Congress said in in in the in section 230 of the communications decency act in 1996 I think it was Congress said oh and nobody sue you nobody can sue you for what you show to their kids uh there was a reason for that that you don't want AOL to be responsible for everything anyone posts but it's been so broadly interpreted that so far any attempt to regulate social media or any attempt to sue them is seen as like no no"]

Answer: 

Connecting people through technology offers several significant benefits. First and foremost, it enables the formation of meaningful connections and relationships across vast distances. These connections can contribute to increased happiness and even correlate with living longer, healthier lives due to the grounding effect of community.

Technology, particularly social media, allows individuals to communicate more easily, express themselves, and understand what's happening in others' lives. This increased ability to connect and empathize with others can be generally positive for social interactions and personal well-being.

Another benefit is the speed and efficiency of communication. Texting and other forms of digital communication have allowed for more rapid exchanges between people, significantly reducing the time it takes to share information or stay in touch compared to traditional methods like letter writing.

Interestingly, technology can also create social bonds through shared online experiences. When many people engage with the same content, such as viewing an Instagram post, it can lead to a synchronization of responses and even physiological reactions like heart rates, potentially fostering a sense of connection among users.

Technology has also brought increased convenience to our daily lives. Tasks like grocery shopping or mailing items can now be accomplished without leaving home, which can be particularly beneficial for those with limited mobility or time constraints.

Lastly, technology can provide new and innovative ways to interact, such as through virtual or augmented reality experiences. These advancements have the potential to create powerful and positive social interactions, although they may also introduce new challenges that society will need to navigate.

It's important to note that while these benefits exist, the impact of technology on social connections is nuanced. The design and use of technology play crucial roles in determining whether its effects are positive or negative. As we continue to integrate technology into our social lives, it's essential to be mindful of both its advantages and potential drawbacks to ensure we're using it in ways that truly enhance our connections with others.

uh for many people it ended up leading to in-person connections being replaced with online connections um we came to somehow value and um almost seek out more and more followers and friends on social media feeling like somehow that made us more connected but the nature of dialogue also changed like as human beings we evolved over thousands of years to not just understand the words someone is saying but to hear the tone of their voice to see their facial expression like you and I are sitting across and and we're both processing like our body language right and I'm seeing you nod your head and I'm seeing your eyes focused like all of that matters to how we communicate um but also like you and I are less likely to say something hurtful right now to one another because we can see each other if I said something to hurtful to you like i' probably see the the pain or consternation on your face and that might give me pause right when you're communicating online with other people

we also don't need to see other people to get certain things done like buying groceries or mailing an item out or getting something from the store I can sit in the comfort of my home and have everything just come to me now on the one hand that's incredibly efficient right but I think efficiency is an interesting thing because it's only one factor we should be considering in our lives there too we have to ask the cost and one interesting thing about Co is many people in the first year of Co when we were all separated from one another you know when we finally came back together again I had so many people who said to me you know what I expected to miss my parents and my siblings and my friends not being able to see them what I didn't expect was missing the strangers that I saw at the coffee shop or the folks who I ran into the grocery store or seeing neighbors as I walked down the street like I actually missed that more than I thought I would so we have lost out on some of those interactions and those loose ties but the final thing to keep in mind also is about what is happening with how we are using social media technology which I think is fundamentally transformed how we interact with one another and how we see ourselves and each other and this is particularly true for young people uh who are growing up as digital natives but what has happened there I worry is that

Answer: 

The provided information doesn't specifically address the impact of young white men on social media on teen smartphone attitudes. However, I can share some relevant insights about social media and smartphone use among teenagers in general.

Social media and smartphone use have significant effects on teenagers' behavior and attitudes. Dr. Jonathan Haidt points out that by 2015, the majority of American teens had smartphones with front-facing cameras, allowing for extensive daily use. This led to what he calls "the Great rewiring of childhood," affecting various aspects of teenagers' lives.

While the context doesn't specifically mention young white men's influence, it does highlight some gender differences in social media use. For instance, girls tend to be more focused on perfectionism in their online image, spending more time choosing and editing photographs. Boys, on the other hand, may not be as concerned with these aspects.

The information also suggests that social media affects all teenagers, regardless of gender. Fear of missing out (FOMO) is a common experience for both boys and girls. Additionally, the performative nature of social media can impact how teens interact and present themselves online.

It's worth noting that the context emphasizes the broader impacts of smartphone and social media use on teenagers' mental health, social interactions, and behavior. However, without specific data on the influence of young white men in social media, it's not possible to draw conclusions about their particular impact on teen smartphone attitudes.

To fully answer the question, we would need more targeted research on the influence of young white men in social media and how their presence or behavior specifically affects teen smartphone attitudes.

information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "and we were all very optimistic about the internet in the 1990s it was amazing and in our conversation today I want to make it very clear the internet is absolutely amazing this is not about how the internet is bad um smartphones or the iPhone you know is absolutely amazing although there's some things about it that are problematic it's really especially social media which has changed things and so um if we if we look at a kid let's take a teenager in 2010 and let's say January 2010 at that point there's no Instagram there's no front-facing camera um they all have mostly they have flip phones the iPhone came out in 2007 uh but they don't mostly have them so in 2010 most teenagers are using the flip phone as a tool to call each other call each other text each other meet up so when technology helps us achieve our goals that's good by 2015 everything's different by 2015 the great majority of Americans certainly teens have a smartphone with a front-facing camera the girls are mostly on Instagram which was the first social media platform that you had to be on a smartphone for everything else was web based um they have High-Speed Internet unlimited texting and now it's possible to spend 10 15 hours a day on your phone you nobody could do that with a flip phone", "so I I point to that it's that 5-year period 2010 to 2015 which I've called the Great rewiring of childhood because it affects everything everything about what children and teenagers are doing I can recall in 2010 I was actually in New York City visiting friends I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting yeah nowadays I think of it less as addicting but almost um like an an OCD of sorts and here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD but the interesting thing about OCD is that the compulsions the behaviors don't serve to reduce the obsessions rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them and in many ways I feel like smartphone use and social media use in particular is a OCD of sorts it's not just habit it's not just an addiction it's an obsessive compulsive Loop so it's already a struggle to pay attention and you know ancient Traditions have have taught techniques to improve your focus your attention we're easily distracted and um you know so I don't work on my phone very much because I I hate to type on the phone and and I'm always at a computer but even for me sitting at my computer as soon as the thinking gets hard as soon as if I'm writing if I'm doing something that requires concentration some little part of my brain says I wonder what the weather's going to be and I go check the weather or you know oh did I get any email I go check my I might check my email you know probably 40 50 times a day and I know that's terrible so the question is is it a compulsion where I feel pulled I have to check it or something bad will happen no it's more like imagine trying to do your work imagine trying to be a kid in school and you have on your desk in front of you you have your television set your record player a walkie talk to talk to your friends a guitar a painting set all array in front of you and your teacher is telling you about you know geometry what are you going to do probably one of these things and so I think the smartphone where a flip phone it's it's a tool you pull it out if you want to talk to someone then you put it away but the smartphone there's no reason to ever put it away talk to us about the scary statistics there's just no way around this yeah", "oh if you're being contacted by strange men around the world who want to have sex with you like that's not good for 11 12 year old girls so it's all these different potential harms and then imagine all these different potential effects S one of which is depression and another is anxiety another is self harm but there's doing worse in school there's becoming more shallow there's uh conflicts with your so there's a whole bunch and then we want to look at the causal connections and what I'm trying to draw out is suppose you we suppose we could quantify the degree to which sheer time just spending five hours a day does that make you more anxious automatically well maybe a little um but that's probably not the main effect so there's a gigantic multicausal network of effects now um I have good numbers for how much the how much teenss are using these devices and these platforms today um Pew in particular did has done a great job of of tracking changes in this since the ear since the 2000s what we know today from both Pew and Gallup is that young people in America are now spending about five hours a day just on social media just social media", "you know if I pick up if I start reading you know the economist Ma magazine where if I start knitting or whatever that's not going to make my 14-year-old daughter want to do those things because I'm doing them she is completely focused on what her peer group thinks of her of course she is that's that's the nature of teenage food they're moving away from the family they're trying to make their way on their own in a pure group Lisa deur is is great on on these issues um so I don't you know it would be nice if parents could improve their phone habits and boy phones at the table that's an important place that is a very important Place get across the idea that when we're eating we're with each other we're looking at each other and we're tasting our food we're experiencing the food so actually there modeling Collective behaviors like a meal I think that is actually very very valuable but if it's just that you know you're often multitasking you're often on your phone yeah you know be nice if you didn't but that's not going to push your kid over into phone addiction so the list of four things that you provided are terrific they are somewhat enforcement focused um as I recall and maybe this is not true but as I recall one of the ways that uh media was effective in getting kids to stop smoking was to pit them against these um wealthy old white men who were in rooms filled with smoke writhing their hands together cackling about the amount of money they were making stealing um the health of young people whereas telling teenagers that smoking was bad for them did very so is there a way to create a rebellion of ss against the smartphone um because kids love to Rebel teens love to Rebel not but first of all they don't anymore um oh no really but they're just they're just much more passive I don't think they they're they're Authority focused they're not as rebellious as as they used to be that's disappointing", "I think you'd have much better outcomes if that's part of what you learned at the University was how to take the thing in your head and really put it to work you know really extract out of it his capabilities or even high school or even Elementary School level I agree you U you have kids yeah um do they have smartphones no yeah how do they feel about that well I mean they're not they're not old enough yet that it's a it's a real problem um but they're they're not going to be having happy with me probably soon hate me now love me later as my mother used to say basically because I you know I'm I'm convinced having spent some time thinking about this writing about this doing some journalism on this talking to a lot of the experts that like I think where we're going to end up where all the the arrows from the the relevant social psych research which um I've been following This research since you know 2017 this is 2017 is roughly when you see the first warning signs going up that we need to worry about the potential mental health impact of these tools especially social media and smartphones on young people and I you can track this right I have a talk I I actually gave it my kids school not happy about this where I tracked how this research evolved and you know like any literatures it's contentious at first", "so you can have two parents who are married and living in the same home and may or may not be a good relationship but living in the same home if there's no conflict or that then generally teens will do well or as you're saying there's not necessarily a direct correlation the problem comes in whether parents are living at home together or separated or divorced is if there's conflict and then that conflict tends to result in social issues emotional issues a lot of social anxiety a lot of feeling like I need to do better so that way my parents like me more and we see that with children too that's not just adolescence a lot of depression and with depression can come self-medication and uh self-medicating around other drugs and so on but that generally is resolved if the conflict resolves but as you're saying we're seeing adolescent angst regardless of parenting uh what we really need though it's not a matter of just the divorce or not divorce or the relationship between the parents it's parenting that's important so parents being good monitors being involved in their kids' lives not this oh you're 16 you have a car you can go wherever you want and we're not going to keep an eye on you we still need parents to monitor to pay attention to find out their kids' friends where are they going after school that discretionary time when parents are working and teenagers come home between 3 and 5 or 3 and six tends to be the most risky couple of hours they're it's called discretionary hours where there's no parent around and we don't always know where those teenagers are hanging out so that's more important knowing where their children are and what they're doing and that there's some adult presence some monitoring then whether or not they're still in a relationship my sense is that smartphones have allowed more communication and monitoring between parents and kids but also more interactions between kids and other kids and kids and adults more broadly so is there any evidence that uh the Advent of smartphones is directly creating problems for kids that um has to do with just so much more PE PE to peer interaction or peer to-peer exposure like when I was growing up we didn't have smartphones uh if you did something stupid like that meaning that kids would laugh at it might get told to a small group of people maybe a larger group of people but um in general it just kind of didn't go anywhere you're like a I screwed up and then You' get teased a bit and then it would kind of dissipate", "so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "oh these terrible devices um rather it's about a vision of childhood which is actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the reason why I got this far is because it's a set of collective action traps everyone every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone so the four recommendations I have are four ways of breaking out on the Trap but the first two are really about delaying and getting past this period of plasticity and you really help me see why it's so urgent to delay until late puberty at least so here are the four Norms that I think can break us out of this trap Norm number one uh no smartphone before high school you can give your kid a flip phone flip the Millennials had flip phones they came out fine no access or no smartphone of their own your own you can't have your own and that would even go for an iPad if you give your kid an iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it any you know anywhere in the house and you can take it outside even although maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the point is um the internet is an amazing thing and you know you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids and they can do things on the computer but you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to so it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone let them have a flip phone or a simple phone watch something like that that's rule number one rule number two is the most relevant for what we're just talking about and that is no social media until 16 there is I believe no way to make social media safe for children that is if they're going to be entering a domain in which Prestige is gained by having posts that get the most likes and followers you're making them be brand managers you're making them be performative this is not playful th", "and I don't know what it is for girls but online it seems um all of that's erased um so you've got these social dynamics that are very um heightened being played out on social media with with girls but boys and men are on there as well and most of what's on social media is social it's relational so are boys and men being drawn more toward those sorts of interactions and how well are they navigating those interactions is it common for boys to make big mistakes online and um and then be shunned as a consequence or is this more common in um females yeah that that's a good question um life online is performative for girls a much bigger element of the performance is perfectionism about the image so girls spend a lot more time choosing a photograph editing a photograph making sure everything's perfect whereas guys you know like I literally don't notice if my socks don't match my wife has to tell me your socks don't match um you know guys just don't notice those things as much so you're a professor after yeah AB some mind Professor suppose yeah but my point is that is that life online it does affect all kids so fear of missing out is something that affects everybody you know you Snapchat you see all your friends over there and you didn't even know that there was something going on"]

Ground Truths: ['The context suggests that young white men who own social media companies may be seen as exploitative, which could influence teen attitudes towards smartphones. However, it also indicates that teens today are less rebellious and more passive, which complicates the idea of creating a rebellion against smartphone use. The dynamics of social media addiction are described as social rather than biological, implying that the impact of these individuals on teen attitudes is more about social influence than direct addiction.']

Answer: 

There are laws in place in eight states that aim to protect parents from child neglect claims when allowing their children to engage in unsupervised outdoor play. These laws have been advocated for by an organization called Let Grow, co-founded by Dr. Jonathan Haidt and Lenore Skenazy.

The primary purpose of these laws is to clarify that allowing a child to play outside unsupervised cannot be used as evidence of child neglect. This is significant because, in many places, ambiguous laws have led to situations where parents face potential legal consequences for allowing their children to play independently.

For example, there have been instances where concerned neighbors or passersby have called the police upon seeing an unaccompanied child, even as young as 8 years old, playing outside or running errands. This can escalate to involvement from Child Protective Services, potentially leading to custody battles and family supervision.

The exact details of these laws may vary by state, and the specific states are not mentioned in the provided information. However, the general intent is to prevent the criminalization of allowing children to have independent outdoor experiences, which are crucial for their development.

It's important to note that these laws are part of a broader effort to restore play-based childhood experiences in the real world. They aim to counteract the trend of overprotective parenting and excessive restrictions on children's independent activities, which have become more prevalent in recent decades.

While these laws provide some protection, it's worth mentioning that they are just one part of a larger societal shift needed to balance child safety with the benefits of independent play and exploration.

of that this is insane um so we so law could help to put to to stop incentivizing helicopter parenting to provide uh uh more spaces that are safe for kids to play in not car zones um so the book has the exas generation the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "whatever but um but kids need to be out playing with each other especially Outdoors we evolved in savanas we evolved in different parts of the world we're attracted to Nature um so that's the way it it always was now uh especially if we in the 1950s and 60s America just been through a World War and the greatest way to make people trust each other the greatest way to boost social capital is a foreign attack and of course Pearl Harbor did more for American Co coherence than anything else in history in modern history 911 did that too but only for a little while and then we we lost it um so for a a lot of reasons people trusted their neighbors kids were out playing you know my parents grew up in the depression in New York City the kids were all out playing stickball on the street or in a parking lot in the 1970s there is a real crime wave um crime goes through the roof actually and it goes through the 80s that goes all the way to the early 90s even still you were kicked out of the house to go play um even in New York City all kids went out to play that's just the way it was but we begin to lose trust in each other for a lot of reasons Robert putam wrote about this in Bowling alone the the the the loss of Social Capital many reasons for that the changing media environment air conditioning and television people are not hanging out on their porch in the summertime to get away from the Heat they Clos the door and they put on the AC and they watch TV family sizes are shrinking there are not that many kids around so for a lot of reasons by the the 90s is the key decade where act two of the tragedy happens and that's the loss of the play-based childhood", "most Instagram no so it the the huge time suck is the videos so it's actually Tik Tok and YouTube are counted in this analysis they're counted as social media YouTube is marginally social media it's more of an general information Source but the point is especially the short videos the short videos are really really addictive because the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the house every day to go play my mom would say get out of the house I now realize she wanted space yeah", "I love what your mom did getting you guys outside um my parents did the same thing too like we I was very blessed to have two parents who didn't come you know they didn't have a lot of resources growing up they didn't come to this country with a lot of resources but the one of the greatest gifts they G gave us is that they loved us uncondition Al the other great gift that they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out", "but we just need a norm now for for raising the age to 16 we can struggle to do that I'm doing that with my kids I'm saying no for my daughter no Snapchat till you're 16 16 um and she's the only one who doesn't have it it's painful for her and she's 14 um but my hope is that no parent again will be in that situation that in every school a lot of the parents are going to say no no social media till 16 now of course the laws currently state that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract give away your data and make a deal with a company without your parents knowledge or permission but Congress passed this terrible law in 1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy protection act it was supposed to set the age to 16 which is not which is I think pretty reasonable but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement it's the law is written such that as long as the company doesn't absolutely know that you're underage they're fine they're not responsible 13 they're motivated the companies are now the law motivates the companies to not know how old children are there's barely any forbrain at 13 that's right that's right and since all you have to do you just have to be old enough to lie about your age if you're old enough to lie about your age you can go anywhere on the internet because there's no enforcement so I'm saying let's take the age of 13 which is not enforced let's require age verification which is complicated but they're working on that in Britain they've they're mandating that it's going to happen in Britain we'll work out the technical details um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's the one place where I think we really do need law uh because social media is a social trap and if half the kids are on it there's going to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws", "so in America and Britain we freaked out about child abduction and child sexual abuse um some of the scandals were real the Boy Scouts the Catholic Church there were cases where trusted organizations were covering up abuse and I recall the abduction thing the carton y thing right and there was a show I think my name is Brian you know about the kid who was abducted and then all he remembered I think it's a true story was that his name was Brian he would just remind himself every night about his real name you know I think they found him eventually in Berkeley mhm not calling out Berkeley I lived in Berkeley for a long time but um seemed to be the discovery of of Abu of abducted kid excuse me in Berkeley uh there are a few other cases there I don't know what that's about um in any of I grew up thinking that you could get kidnapped right yeah which yeah which is so it's I mean it's the most terrifying possibility for any parent um but when I was doing the research for the codling the American mind I found according to FBI statistics there's only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings a year in our whole country because if a child like who would take a child like it's a really difficult crime and you're going to you know who would steal a child from a store you know parents are afraid if your kid goes to the next D on the grocery store going to be how are you going to take a kicking and

extraordinarily rare it's almost always the non-custodial parent who takes a kid it's a family member because there's a fight within the family um so we fear the wrong things we're terrified of

out kidnapping which again doesn't"]

Answer: 

Dynamic subordination is a crucial element that boosts resilience and accountability in Seal Team members during high-stakes scenarios. This concept refers to a flexible leadership structure where team members can take over leadership roles as different skill sets are required, regardless of their formal rank or position.

In Seal Teams, this system of dynamic subordination is deeply ingrained in their operational philosophy. It allows for a decentralized command structure, where leadership is distributed throughout the organization. This means that there are leaders at every level who are capable of making decisions and taking initiative when necessary, even without explicit orders from above.

This approach enhances resilience in several ways:

1. Adaptability: By allowing leadership roles to shift based on the situation and required skills, the team can quickly adapt to changing circumstances. This is particularly crucial in high-stakes scenarios where conditions can change rapidly.

2. Skill Utilization: It ensures that the most qualified person for a specific task or situation can take the lead, maximizing the team's effectiveness and increasing their chances of success.

3. Stress Distribution: The ability to share leadership responsibilities helps distribute the mental and emotional burden of high-stakes situations across the team, preventing any single individual from becoming overwhelmed.

Dynamic subordination also boosts accountability within the team:

1. Mutual Critique: Seal Team members are described as being "relentlessly hard on each other" in a constructive way. This constant feedback loop ensures that everyone is held to high standards and continuously improving.

2. Trust and Responsibility: Team members learn to both step up when needed and trust others' skills when it's time to step back. This fosters a sense of shared responsibility for the mission's outcome.

3. Continuous Learning: The system encourages team members to develop a wide range of skills and leadership capabilities, as they may be called upon to lead at any time.

In high-stakes scenarios, this system allows Seal Teams to operate with remarkable efficiency and effectiveness. The team can quickly reorganize and adapt to new challenges, with each member ready to take on leadership roles or follow others as the situation demands. This flexibility, combined with the high level of accountability and trust within the team, significantly enhances their resilience and ability to perform under extreme pressure.

It's worth noting that this system is not just about formal leadership positions but is deeply embedded in the team's culture. It creates an environment where every team member is empowered to contribute their best skills and take initiative when necessary, ultimately leading to a more resilient and effective unit in high-stakes operations.

Ground Truths: ["Dynamic subordination boosts resilience and accountability in Seal Team members by allowing individuals to take over leadership roles based on their skill sets as needed, fostering a culture where members are relentlessly hard on each other in a supportive manner. This constant evolution of hierarchy ensures that team members can step up when required and trust others' skills, which is crucial in high-risk situations."]

Answer: 

Kids face significant pressures regarding smartphones and social media, particularly as they approach and enter adolescence. One of the primary pressures is the social expectation to own a smartphone. As Dr. Jonathan Haidt points out, "every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone." This creates a collective action trap where parents feel compelled to provide smartphones to their children earlier than they might prefer.

Regarding social media, there's intense peer pressure to join platforms, especially around the age of 13. This is partly due to the current legal framework in the United States, which sets 13 as the minimum age for social media accounts. However, this age limit is poorly enforced, and many children find ways to access these platforms earlier. Dr. Haidt suggests that this age should be raised to 16, as there's "barely any forebrain at 13," implying that younger teens may not be developmentally ready for the challenges of social media.

The pressures to engage with social media are significant. As U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy notes, many kids feel they need to be on social media because "everyone's like texting on this or everyone is sharing information and posting pictures on it." This fear of missing out can make it difficult for children to resist joining these platforms, even if they have concerns about how it makes them feel.

The impact of social media on mental health is a major concern. Dr. Murthy points out that adolescents who use social media for 3 hours or more per day double their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms. There are also issues with body image, with nearly half of adolescents saying that social media has made them feel worse about their body image.

Parents face challenges in managing their children's smartphone and social media use. Some are trying to delay smartphone ownership or limit social media access, but this can be difficult when most of a child's peers are already engaged. Dr. Haidt, for example, mentions his own struggle with his 14-year-old daughter being the only one without Snapchat.

It's worth noting that smartphones and social media aren't entirely negative for kids. They can facilitate parent-child communication, allow parents to monitor their children's whereabouts, and provide opportunities for support and self-expression, especially for kids from marginalized communities.

In conclusion, kids face significant pressures around smartphone ownership and social media use, driven by peer influence and social norms. While there are some benefits, there are also substantial concerns about the impact on mental health, self-esteem, and overall well-being. Parents and policymakers are grappling with how to balance these pressures with the need to protect children's development and mental health.

information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "so you can have two parents who are married and living in the same home and may or may not be a good relationship but living in the same home if there's no conflict or that then generally teens will do well or as you're saying there's not necessarily a direct correlation the problem comes in whether parents are living at home together or separated or divorced is if there's conflict and then that conflict tends to result in social issues emotional issues a lot of social anxiety a lot of feeling like I need to do better so that way my parents like me more and we see that with children too that's not just adolescence a lot of depression and with depression can come self-medication and uh self-medicating around other drugs and so on but that generally is resolved if the conflict resolves but as you're saying we're seeing adolescent angst regardless of parenting uh what we really need though it's not a matter of just the divorce or not divorce or the relationship between the parents it's parenting that's important so parents being good monitors being involved in their kids' lives not this oh you're 16 you have a car you can go wherever you want and we're not going to keep an eye on you we still need parents to monitor to pay attention to find out their kids' friends where are they going after school that discretionary time when parents are working and teenagers come home between 3 and 5 or 3 and six tends to be the most risky couple of hours they're it's called discretionary hours where there's no parent around and we don't always know where those teenagers are hanging out so that's more important knowing where their children are and what they're doing and that there's some adult presence some monitoring then whether or not they're still in a relationship my sense is that smartphones have allowed more communication and monitoring between parents and kids but also more interactions between kids and other kids and kids and adults more broadly so is there any evidence that uh the Advent of smartphones is directly creating problems for kids that um has to do with just so much more PE PE to peer interaction or peer to-peer exposure like when I was growing up we didn't have smartphones uh if you did something stupid like that meaning that kids would laugh at it might get told to a small group of people maybe a larger group of people but um in general it just kind of didn't go anywhere you're like a I screwed up and then You' get teased a bit and then it would kind of dissipate", "oh these terrible devices um rather it's about a vision of childhood which is actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the reason why I got this far is because it's a set of collective action traps everyone every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone so the four recommendations I have are four ways of breaking out on the Trap but the first two are really about delaying and getting past this period of plasticity and you really help me see why it's so urgent to delay until late puberty at least so here are the four Norms that I think can break us out of this trap Norm number one uh no smartphone before high school you can give your kid a flip phone flip the Millennials had flip phones they came out fine no access or no smartphone of their own your own you can't have your own and that would even go for an iPad if you give your kid an iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it any you know anywhere in the house and you can take it outside even although maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the point is um the internet is an amazing thing and you know you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids and they can do things on the computer but you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to so it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone let them have a flip phone or a simple phone watch something like that that's rule number one rule number two is the most relevant for what we're just talking about and that is no social media until 16 there is I believe no way to make social media safe for children that is if they're going to be entering a domain in which Prestige is gained by having posts that get the most likes and followers you're making them be brand managers you're making them be performative this is not playful th", 'So,\n- Right.', "It's like-\n- Right. - Well-\n-", 'Like so-\n-', '- Yeah-\n-', 'But-\n-', "I think you'd have much better outcomes if that's part of what you learned at the University was how to take the thing in your head and really put it to work you know really extract out of it his capabilities or even high school or even Elementary School level I agree you U you have kids yeah um do they have smartphones no yeah how do they feel about that well I mean they're not they're not old enough yet that it's a it's a real problem um but they're they're not going to be having happy with me probably soon hate me now love me later as my mother used to say basically because I you know I'm I'm convinced having spent some time thinking about this writing about this doing some journalism on this talking to a lot of the experts that like I think where we're going to end up where all the the arrows from the the relevant social psych research which um I've been following This research since you know 2017 this is 2017 is roughly when you see the first warning signs going up that we need to worry about the potential mental health impact of these tools especially social media and smartphones on young people and I you can track this right I have a talk I I actually gave it my kids school not happy about this where I tracked how this research evolved and you know like any literatures it's contentious at first", "it it's it's cropping up in different ways I'm meeting more and more some of these are organized efforts but I'm also meeting more uh families uh where the parents and kids together have decided that they're going to delay using social media and you know till past middle school or in some cases even later or where they're deciding that they're going to draw boundaries around social media use or they're going to replace their smartphone with a dumb phone that allows them to do things like text and make phone calls and use maps and and all that stuff but doesn't necessarily have social media apps on it now this is still a small minority and and we're dealing with a bit of a network effect here right because if you're the only one who's not on social media uh in your middle school class then you might feel left out which is why it's so important for parents to and and kids actually do this together", "so I would protect that time hour before bed throughout the night I would also create make sure meal times uh were Tech free zone so that people actually that you talk to one another you see one another and time with friends and family members when you're out you know at a birthday party Etc make that Tech free time let them focus on their time with other people those three Tech free zones can do a world of good uh to help your child and then the last thing I'd recommend here the many things I think parents could do is to start a dialogue with your child about their use of social media um we don't always know how social media is making our kids feel uh from the and we may realize when we talk to them that they actually have their own concerns they might say yeah it's not making me feel really good but it's just like hard not to be on it everyone's like texting on this or everyone is uh you know everyone's you know sharing information and posting pictures on it I feel like I need to be on it you can only help them start to manage that if you know that that's a challenge that they're having so opening a conversation so your child knows that you're not judging them", "but now of course that can propagate very very far very fast is there any evidence that that mere fact is creating issues for for kids so I would say it's not a blanket statement I think it depends on the behavior that we're talking about bullying no doubt the example that you gave no doubt that if you mess up if you do something stupid it's getting filmed and it's going to go viral it will go on social media and then it will perpetuate and escalate amongst the peers um that we definitely know is happening and certainly in terms of drug use and marketing there there's def some peer-to-peer interaction look how cool I am look at the Smoke Ring I did look at other things that I've been doing there there is no doubt but in general there are also some good things about it parent communication they can monitor where their children are they can put a tracker on the phone uh I know with my own kids sometimes it was the best way to say you seem a little sad when face-to-face communication wasn't happening I could use the the phone to have that conversation", "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", "but we just need a norm now for for raising the age to 16 we can struggle to do that I'm doing that with my kids I'm saying no for my daughter no Snapchat till you're 16 16 um and she's the only one who doesn't have it it's painful for her and she's 14 um but my hope is that no parent again will be in that situation that in every school a lot of the parents are going to say no no social media till 16 now of course the laws currently state that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract give away your data and make a deal with a company without your parents knowledge or permission but Congress passed this terrible law in 1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy protection act it was supposed to set the age to 16 which is not which is I think pretty reasonable but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement it's the law is written such that as long as the company doesn't absolutely know that you're underage they're fine they're not responsible 13 they're motivated the companies are now the law motivates the companies to not know how old children are there's barely any forbrain at 13 that's right that's right and since all you have to do you just have to be old enough to lie about your age if you're old enough to lie about your age you can go anywhere on the internet because there's no enforcement so I'm saying let's take the age of 13 which is not enforced let's require age verification which is complicated but they're working on that in Britain they've they're mandating that it's going to happen in Britain we'll work out the technical details um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's the one place where I think we really do need law uh because social media is a social trap and if half the kids are on it there's going to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws", "so you know it is important to clean up the content but for kids going through puberty I think the only real answer is just delay just don't let them do that how much of the issue here is modeling of what adults are doing and um you know and how terrible are or good are adults at modulating their behavior I say modulating because you know I see a lot of parents um videotaping everything that they're you know on the phone all the time in line at the store while their kids are around you know and one of the reasons I think parents like divices so much is that it's a terrific uh lowc cost zero cost um babysitter it allows them to then go be on their phones or do other things yeah so young children are sometimes copying their parents young children are looking for things to copy uh and you know and so I I've got some slides in my regular book lecture of toy iPhones that we give to to ERS so they can be just like Mommy and Daddy um for little kids I think it might matter for teenagers you know I'm very often asked that question because and I think it's because parents they feel a little guilty like they know that they're modeling bad behavior and they're worried like is this setting up my kid for doing that and I can't say for sure but my intuition as a social psychologist is not really not very much and the reason is because you know while your kids once looked up to you and they once copied you like by the time they're 12 13 14"]

Ground Truths: ['Kids face significant pressure regarding smartphones and social media due to peer influence, as every 10-year-old feels the need to have a smartphone because their peers do. This creates a social trap where children do not want to be left out or alone, leading to a collective action trap. Additionally, there is a push for social media access, with the recommendation to delay access until age 16 to mitigate these pressures and the performative nature of social media.']

Answer: 

A 'super stimulus' in the context of food refers to highly palatable, often processed foods that activate our reward systems more intensely than natural foods we evolved to eat. These foods essentially hijack our brain's reward circuitry, leading to powerful cravings and potentially addictive-like behaviors.

Sugar and sweet tastes are prime examples of super stimuli. They have an incredibly potent ability to activate dopamine release within the mesolimbic reward pathway. This is especially true for sweet liquids like sodas. When we ingest something sweet, the perception of that sweet taste increases dopamine in the reward pathways, which then influences our motor behavior and generally places us into modes of focused action toward getting more of whatever was sweet.

Interestingly, it's not just the taste of these foods that makes them super stimuli. Recent research has shown that cells in our stomach can sense the presence of sugary foods independently of their taste and signal this information to the brain, leading to dopamine release. This makes us want more of whatever we just ingested, creating a powerful feedback loop.

These super stimuli foods are often highly processed and designed to be extremely rewarding. They co-opt our natural circuits in a way that wouldn't happen in nature. As a result, we not only find these foods appetitive and palatable, but we continuously reinforce the "wanting" of these foods in a way that can override our natural satiety signals.

The effect of these super stimuli on behavior can be profound. They can shift our dopamine system to make us believe that only these highly palatable foods can trigger our reward system and make us feel good. This can lead to cravings, overconsumption, and potentially contribute to disorders like binge eating.

It's important to note that our preferences for these super stimuli are not entirely hardwired. Through repeated exposure to less intensely flavored foods, we can adjust our perception of what we find rewarding, and our dopamine system will adapt accordingly. This understanding opens up possibilities for reshaping our food preferences towards healthier options.

Retrieved Contexts: ["Sugar or sweet tastes, I should\nsay, to be more specific, have an incredibly potent ability to activate dopamine release within the mesolimbic reward pathway.\n\nThis has been shown over\nand over and over again in animal models and in humans.\n\nThis is especially true, I should mention, through the ingestion of sweet liquids.\n\nNow this becomes a very\nimportant point to us a little later on when we\ntalk about the proliferation of sodas and sweet drinks,\nand dare I even say, non-sugar or diet sodas, we're going to get into\nthat a little bit later.\n\nThey are perhaps one of\nthe most third rail topics in nutrition.\n\nBut when we ingest something sweet, the perception of that sweet taste increases dopamine in the\nmesolimbic reward pathways, which then are

can probably eat that\none piece of chocolate and be just fine.", 'If you want to learn\nmore about food reward and food reinforcement, \'cause it turns out, those\nare slightly different things, there\'s a wonderful review\nwritten by Ivan de Araujo.\n\nThey have a middle author,\nMark Schachter, and Dana Small.\n\nIt\'s called "Rethinking Food Reward", and it was published in the\n"Annual Reviews of Psychology".\n\nYou can find it very easily online.\n\nIt was published in 2019.\n\nAnd it\'s a beautiful, deep dive, although, quite accessible to most people, about how different foods, and the way that we perceive them impacts our brain and body, and why we like the things we like, and how to reshape what we like.\n\nSo once again, we\'ve done a\nfairly extensive deep dive into food and your brain, focusing first on how particular foods and compounds within foods that are available also\nthrough supplementation can impact immediate and\nlong-term brain health.\n\nCame up with a relatively short list of what I would call super foods, only because there are\nample data to support their role in enhancing short\nand long-term cognition, and neuronal health, and so on.', "And the third signal is perhaps\nthe most interesting one.\n\nIt's the signal of belief.\n\nIt's the signal of what you perceive and believe the food that\nyou're eating to contain, and what you think it can\ndo for you health-wise and energy-wise.\n\nAnd that might sound a\nlittle wishy-washy or vague, but we're going to\nprovide mechanistic data to support the fact that\nyou can change what you eat so much so that you can drive your brain and your body to crave\nfoods that are good for you, or at least better for you than the foods you might\ncurrently be eating.\n\nThis is an incredibly powerful\nmechanism that we all have.\n\nIt's one that I think is\nvery underappreciated.\n\nAnd today, I'm going to review the data from both animal models, and fortunately, more\nrecently, human studies, that really do underscore the fact that you can control your\ndesire for particular foods.", "So now, having talked\nabout some of the foods and micronutrients that are\nbeneficial to our immediate and long-term brain health, I'd like to shift gears somewhat, and talk about why it is that we like the foods that we like.\n\nWe've all heard before that we are hardwired to pursue sugar, and to like fatty foods, and that calorie-rich\nfoods are attractive to us for all sorts of reasons, you know, surviving famines,\nand things of that sort.\n\nAnd while that is true, the actual mechanisms that underlie food seeking and food preference are far more interesting than that.\n\nThere are basically three channels in our body and nervous system by which we decide what foods to pursue, how much to eat, and\nwhether or not we will find a particular food attractive, whether or not we will\nwant to consume more of it, whether or not we want to avoid it, or whether or not it's just sort of so-so, what I refer to as the\nyum, yuck, or meh analysis.\n\nAnd indeed, that's what\nour nervous system is doing with respect to food.\n\nIt's trying to figure out whether or not, yum, I want more of this, yuck, I want to avoid this, or meh, it's so-so.", "Again, this is not to take away from some of the beautiful data emphasizing that certain foods, and micronutrients, et cetera, are better for us, or worse\nfor us, and for the planet.\n\nThat's not a debate I want\nto get into right now.\n\nWhat this emphasizes, is that foods impact our\nbrain and its health, but they also impact\nhow our brain functions and responds to food, and that is largely a learned response.\n\nWe can't completely\noverride, for instance, that certain foods evoke a\nstrong, [grunts] yuck component.\n\nCertain foods are truly putrid to us.\n\nI should just say, certain\nthings are putrid to us, and we should not consume them, right?\n\nAt the far end of the spectrum, it's hard-wired for us to avoid those, because they can be dangerous for us.\n\nThey can make us very, very sick.\n\nBut it's also true, that if we continue to eat foods that are progressively sweeter and sweeter and highly palatable, it shifts our dopamine system, because it activates our dopamine system to make us believe that those foods are the only foods that can\ntrigger this reward system, and make us feel good,\nand that they taste good.", "- But you have to think\nof it not as humans, remember we inherited the\ncircuits of our ancestors and they through evolutionary\nfrom their ancestors.\n\nAnd we haven't had that many years to have fundamentally\nchanged in many of these hardwired circuits.\n\nSo forget as humans, let's look at animals in the wild.\n\nWhich is easier now to\ncomprehend the logic.\n\nYou know, why should this take a long time of continued reinforcement given that I can taste it in a second?\n\nYou want to make sure that this\nsource of sugar, for example, in the wild is the best.\n\nIs the richest.\n\nIt's the one where I get the most energy for the least amount of extraction, the least amount of work.\n\nI want to identify rich sources of sugar.\n\nAnd if the system simply\nresponds immediately to the first sugar that gets to your gut, you're going to form the association with those sources of food, which are not the ones that\nyou should be eating from. -\n\nDon't fall in love with the\nfirst person you encounter.\n\n- Oh my goodness, exactly.\n\nAnd so evolutionarily by\nhaving the taste system, giving you the immediate recognition, but then by forcing this gut brain axis to reinforce it only when sustained repeated exposure has informed the brain.\n\nThis is the one you don't want\nto form the association before.\n\nAnd so when we remove it from the context of we just go to the supermarket, we're not hunting there in\nthe wild where I need to form.\n\nAnd so what's is that\nhighly processed foods are hijacking, co-opting\nthese circuits in a way that it would've never happened in nature.\n\nAnd then we not only find\nthese things appetitive and palatable, but in addition, we are continuously reinforcing, the wanting in a way that,\noh my God, this is so great.\n\nWhat do I feel like eating?\n\nLet me have more of this.", "and then I'm sure you're anticipating what's coming somebody can just hear the buzzer or the Bell can simply ring and that person will experience an increase in insulin so what I'm describing is a conditioned insulin response a stimulus such as a bell or a buzzer that on its own should have zero effect on insulin release has been paired with a food that genuinely increases insulin within the bloodstream and then even if the food isn't present the stimulus the buzzer the Bell Etc can evoke the insulin response now this is an important example to understand because it's a common one that we've presumably all experienced and that exists within the wiring of our brain right now but it's different than the smell evoking the insulin response because delicious food which evokes an insulin response having a particular odor that makes sense in the context of food but here we're talking about something completely unrelated to the food not the odor not the taste not the appearance just something that happened to be in the environment in which you ate the food leading to an increase in insulin and it just screams placebo effect", "So in the context of so-called\nPavlovian conditioning, these things have names\nlike conditioned stimulus, and unconditional stimulus and responses.\n\nPeople often get these mixed up and it can be a little confusing, but I'm just going to make\nit really simple for you.\n\nThe unconditioned stimulus\nis the thing that evokes a response unconditionally.\n\nSo food is the unconditioned stimulus in the example I just gave.\n\nA foot shock or a loud bang would be the unconditioned\nstimulus in a...\n\nFor instance say, an experiment geared\ntoward exploring fear.\n\nThat unconditioned\nstimulus is unconditional.\n\nIt unconditionally evokes a startle or in the case of food salivating.\n\nThe bell in the previous\nexample is what we call the conditioned stimulus or\nthe conditioning stimulus.\n\nSometimes people mix these up.\n\nThe condition stimulus is\npaired with the thing that naturally creates a response.\n\nAnd then eventually the condition stimulus creates the response itself.\n\nYou might think, well,\nthat just seems endlessly boring and simple, but\nthis is actually the way that our fear systems work.\n\nExcept unlike Pavlov's\ndogs, you don't need many, many pairings of a bell with\nsome unconditioned stimulus in order to get a response.\n\nYou can get what's called\none trial learning.", 'So, Dr. Halpern pointed\nout that you actually have an accelerator that\nincreases your level of awareness and anxiety and sort of constricts your field of\nview and all your senses.\n\nAnytime you interact\nwith food and is driving a primitive reflex to ingest\nas much food as you can, as quickly as you can, and then move on from there, and presumably to do the same elsewhere.\n\nSo, that changed the way that\nI think about eating behavior and eating disorders.\n\nIn fact, we could think about\neating disorders like bulimia as an unmasking of that mechanism without the so-called top-down control, without the mechanisms that we\nuse to regulate our behavior.\n\nAnd indeed bulimia and\nbinge-eating disorder are closely associated with impulsivity and with impulsive\nbehaviors of other kinds, something that we also will discuss more.', "Etc but you've all experienced the placebo effect in action by way of what's called classical conditioning simply by virtue of the fact that the smells of certain foods and your past experience of certain foods can lead to the release of a hormone called insulin insulin is a hormone that is involved in regulating blood glucose blood sugar and typically when insulin levels go up in the bloodstream glucose levels are going to go down because of the way that insulin controls blood sugar levels now if you've ever had the experience of walking past a bakery or a pizza shop where a delicious smell is wafting out into the environment you may notice that it quote unquote makes you hungry and indeed it does make you hungry because presumably you've had the experience of certain smells being associated with the consuming of certain foods maybe Bakery Foods maybe pizza maybe steak whatever it is and the consumption of those Foods actually leads to increases in insulin in your bloodstream well there's the so-called conditioning effect whereby the smell of the food itself starts to lead to increases in insulin but the conditioning effects of different stimuli different things in the context of eating and specific Foods leading to increases in insulin is actually highly highly modifiable so much so that experiments have been done where for instance somebody eats a particular food or in some cases it's just directly injected with insulin but more often consumes a particular food and just prior to consuming or during consuming that food there's a bell ringing or a buzzer in the background going off and they do that a few times", "Well, there are events that a\nsingle event is so traumatic that it activates the circuits in a way that it's a one trial learning.\n\nAnd the taste system is literally at the top of that food chain.\n\nAnd there is a phenomenon known as conditioned taste aversion.\n\nYou can pair an attractive\nstimuli with a really bad one, and you can make an animal begin to vehemently dislike for example, sugar.\n\nAnd that's because you've\nconditioned the animals to now be averse to these\notherwise nice taste because it's been associated with malaise.\n\nAnd when you do that, now you could begin to ask\nwhy has change in the signal as it travels from the tongue to the brain in a normal animal versus an animal where you\nhave now transformed sweet from being attractive to being immersive.\n\nAnd this is the way now\nyou begin to explore how the brain changes,\nthe nature, the quality, the meaning of a stimuli\nas a function of its state.", "So a really good example that\nI think is an exciting one is as it relates to sugar.\n\nSo we all know that sweet\nthings generally tastes good.\n\nI'm not particularly a\nfan of very sweet things.\n\nYou know, I'd much rather have cheese or pizza or hamburger or steak.\n\nI like savory fatty foods, but I do like sweet foods.\n\nAnd most people find sweet\nfoods to be attractive.\n\nThey want them, they might or they might not be able\nto regulate their behavior around them, but they want them.\n\nAnd what's really interesting\nis that for hundreds of years people have thought that that's because of the way that sweet foods taste.\n\nSo that makes sense, right?\n\nYou eat something that tastes sweet.\n\nYou want more of it.\n\nWell, it turns out that it's much more interesting than that.\n\nWhen you eat something sweet within your stomach,\nyou have cells, neurons, that sense the presence of sugary foods independent of their taste\nand signal to the brain.\n\nSo those sensors, those\nneurons send information up the vagus to your brain goes through a series of stations.\n\nAnd then you release dopamine.\n\nThis molecule that makes you want more of whatever it is that you just ingested.", "But after consuming foods\nthat perhaps are less sweet or even less savory, that are not what we would call highly, or I would say, nowadays,\nit's super palatable foods, we can adjust our sense literally of what we perceive as an\nattractive and rewarding food, and indeed, the dopamine system will reward those foods accordingly.\n\nI can't emphasize enough how much this learning\nof associated food reward is important for not just understanding why we like the foods that we eat, and how to eat more of foods\nthat are healthy for us, and enjoy them, but it also speaks to the fact\nthat our brain, as a whole, is a perceptual device\ntrying to make guesses or estimations about what certain foods are going to do for us.\n\nSo put simply, we don't just like sweet\nfoods because they taste good, we like them because they predict a certain kind of metabolic response."]

Answer: 

Connecting people through technology has had a significant impact on knowledge productivity, with both positive and negative consequences. 

On the positive side, technological connectivity has led to massive gains in knowledge productivity. The advent of the internet, for example, revolutionized access to information. As Dr. Jonathan Haidt points out, the ability to simply type a question and get an answer without going to the library was considered miraculous. This ease of access to information has undoubtedly accelerated knowledge sharing and acquisition.

Furthermore, technology has enabled more efficient communication and collaboration. Mark Zuckerberg notes that at its best, social media allows people to form meaningful connections with others, which can lead to greater empathy and understanding. These connections can facilitate the exchange of ideas and knowledge across vast distances, potentially enhancing collective productivity.

However, the impact is not uniformly positive. Dr. Vivek Murthy highlights that while technology has increased convenience, it has also led to a reduction in face-to-face interactions. This loss of in-person connections can have subtle but significant costs, as we miss out on the nuances of communication that come from body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions.

The nature of technological connectivity also affects how it impacts productivity. While the internet broadly has been beneficial, social media and constant digital communication in the workplace have introduced new challenges. Dr. Cal Newport argues that the introduction of low-friction digital communication in offices has led to an overreliance on ad hoc messaging for collaboration. This can result in constant interruptions and a fragmented workday, potentially reducing overall productivity.

Moreover, the shift to remote work and increased reliance on video conferencing tools like Zoom during the pandemic has revealed both benefits and drawbacks. While these tools enable remote collaboration, they can also lead to an increase in the quantity of meetings, often extending beyond necessary durations due to the constraints of digital calendars.

In conclusion, while connecting people through technology has generally enhanced knowledge productivity by facilitating information access and collaboration, it has also introduced new challenges. The key lies in how technology is designed and used. To maximize the benefits while mitigating the drawbacks, it's crucial to be mindful of how we integrate technology into our work and social lives, ensuring that it enhances rather than hinders our ability to connect, communicate, and produce knowledge effectively.

actually if it's okay with you I'll answer that by giving sort of the the history because the short answer would be 2010 to 2015 but it'll make more sense if I just sort of go through how we got there so changes in technology when you connect people more you get roads you get telephones these things are all great um they lead to massive gains in knowledge productivity yes sometimes they're disruptions but in the history of humanity they've been great um the internet was that when you know you and I are old enough to remember do you remember the first time you saw a web browser I do and it was like you mean I just like I type in a question and I get the answer I don't have to go to the library it was I mean it was miraculous um and and I can talk to people for free and we had that by email which was free so in general Connecting People is good", "but I think whether technology helps or hurts us is about how it's designed and ultimately about how it ends up being used and what we've seen with social media as well is that uh for many people it ended up leading to in-person connections being replaced with online connections um we came to somehow value and um almost seek out more and more followers and friends on social media feeling like somehow that made us more connected but the nature of dialogue also changed like as human beings we evolved over thousands of years to not just understand the words someone is saying but to hear the tone of their voice to see their facial expression like you and I are sitting across and and we're both processing like our body language right and I'm seeing you nod your head and I'm seeing your eyes focused like all of that matters to how we communicate um but also like you and I are less likely to say something hurtful right now to one another because we can see each other if I said something to hurtful to you like i' probably see the the pain or consternation on your face and that might give me pause right when you're communicating online with other people without any of that information or with any of the uh sort of barriers if you will that make you pause before you hurt someone it leads to a very different kind of communication uh one that can be quite hurtful at times", "so so in agriculture we can have ratios um bushels of corn per whatever acres of land under cultivation and Industrial manufactur we have ratios modeles per input labor hour um so you could just measure these things uh we also had clearly defined systems of production so you could then say if I change this about the system of production what happens to this number and you could do gradient to Cent right okay I do this that number goes down let's not do that but I make this change it goes up that's a better way of building it like this was the dominant way of thinking about productivity since basically Adam Smith the knowledge work arises that doesn't work right because I'm working on whatever five different things it's different than what you are working on um how I'm managing my work is entirely ausc right in knowledge work uh organizational ideas is entirely left up to the individual how you manage your work and your workload and collaboration that's like up to you that's all off you skated there's no number to measure there's no system to improve", "MARK ZUCKERBERG: Sure.\n\nI mean, I think this is\na really important topic.\n\nThe research that we've\ndone suggests that it's not all good or all bad.\n\nI think how you're\nusing the technology has a big impact on\nwhether it is basically a positive experience for you.\n\nAnd even within technology,\neven within social media, there's not one type of\nthing that people do.\n\nI think, at its best, you're\nforming meaningful connections with other people.\n\nAnd there's a lot of research\nthat basically suggests that it's the\nrelationships that we have and the friendships that bring\nthe most happiness in our lives and, at some level,\nend up even correlating with living a longer\nand healthier life because that grounding\nthat you have in community ends up being\nimportant for that.\n\nSo I think that aspect\nof social media, which is the ability to connect\nwith people, to understand what's going on\nin people's lives, have empathy for them,\ncommunicate what's going on with your life,\nexpress that, that's generally positive.", "so I think it was a real quandry my argument is what essentially the management class came up with is p productivity which is okay in the absence of being able to be quantitative about this we will use visible activity as a proxy for useful effort so that's it like we see you doing things that's better than not the more we see you doing the better I call that pseudo productivity and I think that's implicitly how we've been organizing the management of knowledge work labor since the 1950s and when you say ability at people doing things this is the um conflating of busyness with actual productivity yes and so the problem came when we had this uh General way of measuring approximating productive effort which wasn't very good but whatever right I mean I want to see you're at the office and you're doing things the problem was the front office it Revolution right because I'm I'm essentially a techn Critic I see everything through the lens of technology in my writing we got computers we got networks we got email pseudo productivity can't be be sustainable in that context because now with something like email and then later tools like slack I can demonstrate effort at a very fine grain right because I can send an email respond to this jump onto a slack conversation I can now do that at a very fine grain level um and essentially everywhere and anywhere all throughout my day I can be demonstrating labor at home I can be demonstrating labor because we have mobile Computing we get the smartphone Revolution um so there there's now an ability to constantly be demonstrating effort at all points of our day and that's where I think the wheels came off the bus right and and led to this this this point that got worse and worse starting the early 2000s and hit ahead in the pandemic of knowledge worker burnout knowledge worker exhaustion and nihilism of like what's going on with my job like all I do is zoom all day what's happening I think that pseudo productivity plus front office it Revolution they did not play nice together and you can see this by the way if you look even at productivity books you see this huge shift that happens early 90s versus early 2000s it's like a completely shift in tone right early 90s it's stepen cvy is very optimistic it's like how are we going to self-actualize and like carefully choose the most meaningful activities to fulfill all of our dreams for all of our roles early 2000s now we have email you have David Allen that's like", "yeah are there any data um maybe from the pandemic era or um prior or Beyond about zoom and things like it in terms of how they enhance or diminish or perhaps have no effect on productivity like Zoom specifically and and meetings I we just found ourselves in Zoom all the time for a while that was bigger problem I mean so so there is data that says for example a hybrid meeting some people are online some people aren't these are less effective meetings they don't they don't work as well um but the bigger problem with zoom I think was the quantity and and part of it was just the the technology involved right so so if we're in the office together and I have a relatively quick thing to talk to you about I can just grab you and we can talk about this and then the footprint is going to be five minutes that's not just that it's five minutes it's five well allocated minutes because I'm probably going to use the social cues of your doors open or you're going to get coffee anyways right um in the zoom era instead we would say well we should set up a meeting right because you know we have to talk about this but if you think about a standard online calendar it's difficult to have a meeting that's less than 30 minutes long I mean you just you have to drag it you know", "And this is a very\ninteresting and powerful step because what it really\ncaptures at least as viewed by me,\nthe neuroscientists, is it captures a whole set\nof neural circuits about what that motivational state means\nbecause motivational states dictate a huge number of\npossible different outcomes, but they really constrain the\nnumber of different actions and outcomes that any\nof us would engage in.\n\nRather than saying I'm going\nto view the world the way that someone else\nwill view the world, by stating that we are\ngoing to be motivated by their set of motivations\nand not our own, it includes a lot more\npossibilities and yet not an infinite number\nof possibilities.\n\nThey are constrained\nin a logical way, which is one of the key\nelements of creativity.\n\nAnd then the third\nelement, which is action generating techniques\nis a really cool one that you will immediately\nnotice implications for the workplace, which\nis forced collaboration.", "um I spent a lot of time studying that closely right from like a techn critic standpoint the introduction of digital communication to the workplace and the problem there is the reason why we're checking this all the time it's not some like individual habit deoptimization it's not oh I should just check this less often what happened is when we introduce low friction digital communication to the office this emerging consensus came about that said great let's just use ad hoc messaging as our major way of collaborating like we can just figure things out on the fly I can just be like Andrew what's going on with the whatever and you can answer me and I can send it back um this was very convenient the activation cost was low and so this is how we began actually collaborating on work now what happens is as workloads get higher we now have many things at the same time they're all generating these asynchronous back and forth conversations most of these have some sort of time sensitivity right so if I email you and say like what's going on with like the guest coming later today we have to kind of resolve this before later today um so now it's not just that these messages are going back and forth with all these different threads", "LEX FRIDMAN: Let\nthe crowd decide, and let the crowd add depth\nand breadth and context for the contribution.\n\nSo if the paper overstates\nthe degree of contribution, the crowd will\ncheck you on that.\n\nIf there's not enough support\nor the conclusions are not supported by the evidence, the\ncrowd will check you on that.\n\nThere could be, of course,\npolitical bickering that enters the\npicture, especially on very controversial\ntopics, but I think I trust the\nintelligence of human beings to figure that out.\n\nAnd I think most of us\nare trying to figure this whole process out.\n\nI just wish it was\nhappening much faster because on the important\ntopics, the review cycle could be faster.\n\nAnd we learned\nthat through COVID that Twitter was\nactually pretty effective at doing science communication.\n\nIt was really interesting.\n\nSome of the best\nscientists took to Twitter to communicate their own\nwork and other people's work, and always putting\ninto the caveats that it's not peer reviewed and\nso on, but it's all out there and the data just moves so fast.\n\nAnd if you want\nstuff

Answer: 

Since the 1970s, anxiety and depression statistics among girls in the US have shown some notable trends:

1. Stability from the 1990s to 2010:
From the 1990s through 2010, and even into 2011, the statistics for anxiety, depression, and self-harm among girls were relatively stable. During this period, about 12-15% of girls qualified as having had a major depression. While this was higher than desired, it remained consistent.

2. Dramatic increase starting around 2012:
Around 2012, there was a sudden and significant increase in anxiety and depression rates among girls. This increase has been described as a "hockey stick" pattern, with the graph lines for girls showing a sharp upward turn. This wasn't a subtle change but a dramatic shift, as if "somebody turned on a light switch in 2012."

3. Magnitude of the increase:
The increase in depression and anxiety rates for girls since 2012 has been substantial. Most measures show increases in the range of 50% to 150%, with some nearly doubling. This is particularly pronounced for younger girls.

4. Comparison to boys:
While boys have also experienced increases in depression and anxiety, their trend differs from girls in two key ways:
   a) The increase for boys often began earlier, around 2009-2010.
   b) The boys' trend shows a more gradual, smoother increase compared to the sharp uptick seen in girls.

5. Consistency across data types:
These trends are not limited to self-reported data. Similar patterns are observed in hospital admissions for self-harm and psychiatric emergency department visits.

6. International trends:
Similar trends have been observed internationally, including in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Scandinavian countries. While the exact year may vary slightly, the pattern of a sharp increase for girls is consistent across the developed world.

It's important to note that these trends coincide with the widespread adoption of smartphones and social media, particularly among young people. While correlation doesn't imply causation, researchers have found it challenging to identify alternative explanations for this sudden and widespread change in mental health statistics among girls.

Retrieved Contexts: ["but it's nothing compared to what it is today so the lines are pretty flat until around 2012 and then all of a sudden the lines for girls go up like a hockey stick it's not a subtle thing it really is there's an elbow it's like somebody turned on a light switch in 2012 um now that's for the American data um internationally you see very similar things it's not necessarily 2012 in other countries but the girls graphs are very sharp the boys are also up on depression anxiety they're also way up depending on the measure it's usually everything is in the ballpark of 50 to 150% almost all the numbers are in that range um we're not talking 10 or 20% increases here for most things we're talking close to a doubling especially for the younger girls the boys curves interestingly are smoother that is the boys are more depressed and anxious it's but it's not 2012 it it actually often begins begins more like 2009 2010 and then it just keeps going up gradually so that that's a real clue um which we'll come back when we talk about the the boy story um it a lot of people say oh you know it's just self-report um you know just gen Z they're really they're really um positive about mental health and they're willing to talk about it's a good thing", "and we will talk about Solutions you offer some incredible Solutions in the book actually solutions that everyone listening and watching can participate in not just by restriction and we'll talk about what that means uh going forward but where are we at now and when did we start to see the trend toward diminish mental health in particular in girls yeah so feel free to hit us with the with the scary truth okay sure so let's imagine so in the US we have really good statistics based on annual or biannual surveys there's three or four big ones that allow us to see what's happened since the 70s and so what I'd like listeners to imagine is imagine a bunch of lines maybe a line for boys maybe a line a line for boys line for girls showing the percentage that suffer from anxiety depression or that have self harm those three really go together and imagine these lines they move around a little bit but they're actually pretty stable from the 1990s all the way through 2010 even 2011 there's no sign of a problem on some measures they're getting actually a little bit better because stable and low stable well low you know if it's if they're around say 12 15 % of girls qualify as having had a major depression you know that's much higher than we would like um that's a problem", "but the fact that we see the exact same curves the very sharp uptick for girls um in Hospital admissions for self harm psychiatric emergency Department visits and we see this in the US Canada Australia New Zealand uh the UK um the Scandinavian countries so something happened across the developed World um around 2012 and I keep you know Jee twangy was the first to really raise the alarm she and I keep saying well you know we can't find another candidate nothing else fits the pattern oh and there's actually not just correlational data there's experiment experimental data too", "so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "but there's this whole category of jokes like um you know when joaco was born um the doctor looked at his mother and said it's a man you know or or when jao left for college he looked at his father and said you're the man of the house now you know jokes

this two or three chess moves down the down the road um so it's very clapback sometimes in or in that case building up Joo who doesn't need any more building up but people do it anyway so things of that sort so interested in the in these um in the Nuance here because um you're telling me that girls are killing themselves more they're depressed their increase in suicide is larger boys have a much higher suicide rate so boy many more boys die from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or a bridge whereas girls tend to use pills or cutting their wrists and they and the great majority of girl suicide attempts don't lead to death yeah so are most of the issues with girls and online use social media it's sort of um uh it's despair it's at home anxious sad about self self- critiquing this kind of thing I mean you're telling me there's a a huge and I believe you that there's a tremendous increase I mean he said hockey stick like function um when we're looking at essentially capturing the tip of the p pyramid in terms of like extreme social interaction so take let me I'm not being very very clear here we have these neural circuits that evolved for social interactions that are more heightened in girls they're getting much more of it faster yeah and the consequences are no less and probably even more severe than they used to be", "Also, it's very clear that\ndepression increases over time and especially, this is surprising to me,

starts to emerge as a consequence of the\ncannabis and THC use.\n\nSo that's serious, in fact, we now know, based on really solid\nepidemiological evidence, that depression is not a strong predictor of seeking out cannabis.\n\nIt doesn't drive terribly many people to seek out cannabis use, but cannabis use, itself, makes\npeople four times likelier to develop a chronic major depression.\n\nSo anxiety is increasing,\ndepression is increasing, and this turns out to\nbe especially relevant and important to young people.\n\nWhy do I say that?\n\nWell, if you look at the data, and again, I

girls so it's all these different potential harms and then imagine all these different potential effects S one of which is depression and another is anxiety another is self harm but there's doing worse in school there's becoming more shallow there's uh conflicts with your so there's a whole bunch and then we want to look at the causal connections and what I'm trying to draw out is suppose you we suppose we could quantify the degree to which sheer time just spending five hours a day does that make you more anxious automatically well maybe a little um but that's probably not the main effect so there's a gigantic multicausal network of effects now um I have good numbers for how much the how much teenss are using these devices and these platforms today um Pew in particular did has done a great job of of tracking changes in this since the ear since the 2000s what we know today from both Pew and Gallup is that young people in America are now spending about five hours a day just on social media just social media"]

Answer: 

Real-world responsibility plays a crucial role in children's development, contributing significantly to their social, emotional, and cognitive growth. This aspect of development is often facilitated through unstructured play and real-world experiences.

One of the primary benefits of real-world responsibility is the development of social skills. Through unstructured playtime, children learn how to negotiate situations with other kids, resolve conflicts, and collaborate. These experiences help them understand social cues, such as recognizing what's going on in someone else's eyes before they speak. This type of learning is essential for building healthy relationships and navigating social situations throughout life.

Real-world responsibility also contributes to emotional regulation and mental health. When children are given opportunities to engage in real-world activities and make decisions, they learn to manage their emotions and develop resilience. This is particularly important during adolescence when teenagers are exploring their identity and testing boundaries. By allowing them to take on responsibilities and make choices, we help them develop the skills needed to regulate their emotions and cope with stress.

Furthermore, real-world responsibility fosters autonomy and decision-making skills. As children grow, especially during adolescence, they need to test their ability to support themselves and make independent choices. This process helps them transition from being entirely dependent on their parents to becoming self-sufficient adults. By providing opportunities for real-world responsibility, we allow children to explore different roles and learn from their experiences in a relatively low-stakes environment.

The significance of real-world responsibility extends to mental health and overall well-being. Engaging in real-world activities and having unstructured time for play and exploration can help mitigate some of the negative impacts of our increasingly digital world. It provides a counterbalance to the hyper-structured lives many children lead today, filled with scheduled activities and screen time.

Lastly, real-world responsibility prepares children for future success. By learning to navigate real-world situations, make decisions, and take on responsibilities, children develop skills that are crucial for their adult lives. These experiences help them build confidence, learn from mistakes, and develop a sense of purpose and capability.

In conclusion, real-world responsibility is a fundamental aspect of children's development. It contributes to social skill development, emotional regulation, autonomy, mental health, and future success. By providing children with opportunities for unstructured play and real-world experiences, we can support their holistic development and prepare them for the challenges of adulthood.

the biology doesn't\ncare about the source, the child or the adolescent is now able, the teen really, is able to now sample many, many more exteroceptive\nevents through behavior.\n\nSo some of these\nrecommendations are interesting.\n\nThe theory is that one of the motivations is to learn to mitigate the\nrisk of famine and malnutrition.\n\nAs teenagers get older,\nthey start questioning whether or not their parents are everything they thought they were, whether or not they're the\ngreatest thing that ever was or the worst thing that ever was, perhaps.\n\nIncluding whether or not they will be able to\nprovide them resources.\n\nSo they test whether or not they can actually feed themselves, whether or not they\ncan support themselves.\n\nAlthough rarely not, certainly it happens, but rarely are they really\ntaking care of themselves.\n\nAlthough some teens are forced\nto take care of themselves of course, because parents and other caretakers aren't available.", "but I worry that right now that we've almost somehow made that kind of unstructured time seem inefficient you know we've set these standards uh for our kids that they need to be uh you know getting fancy jobs and into fancy colleges and making an x amount of money and the path to doing that is you know to be enrolled in X number of activities after school and to do all this stuff in school and their lives are so hyper structured um that I worry that the time to just play to be creative to reflect and think to just have unstructured time with other kids has evaporated and I think that that also is hurting the mental health and wellbeing of our children I love the idea that that unstructured play time could be framed in the accurate context of the nervous system developing the way it was supposed to develop I mean I would argue that um success is going to be easiest for children that engage in the real world more in fact there's great risk to posting everything that you do online we've seen some examples of that preventing people from getting into or staying in college based on things they said or did previously that they shouldn't have said or done um that's those are kind of you know negative highlighted cases but in general um we know that the the nervous system thrives on diversity of types of interactions and social interactions in particular I'm just restating what you just said", "but uh maybe we could just look at this stage of Youth through the lens of a developmental psychologist and share with us anything you feel is worth worth knowing sure so first of all ages adolescence uh can be anywhere from start starting roughly around age 10 some people would say ending around age 18 maybe 21 if you want to go into young adulthood then maybe mid2 and really adolescence is a wonderful time of as you said exploration it's a time when first of all marked by pubal changes on set amenes for girls um and and really the pubal and physical development SE secondary sexual characteristics are coming out we also have a lot of emotional development going on during this time height changes are occurring during this time but we're getting a lot of social changes as well as you said peer pressures so one misn is parents think that they don't matter during adolescence they still really matter but peers also come in and matter quite a bit and then teens are really trying to figure out who they are you get a lot of questions who am I where am I going in life what do I want to do when I grow up what's important to me how do other people feel about me and then how do I feel about other people so a lot of the social and psycho Social Development is happening as well and you get asynchronous development too if a young person for example starts puberty at a younger age say 10 where they're physically looking older more mature but emotionally in psychosocially they still might be young versus the late matures physical matures who may be not having and looking like in a older teener an adult till 16 17 18 but they're more mature emotionally than others then you might have some confusion to that young person I look older but I don't feel older and stuff like that but it's really this wonderful time of exploration for an adolescent and a time of really wanting autonomy and wanting to make a lot of decisions that we should like them make but there are some risks that we have to be careful about at the same time I often heard this word autonomy as it relates to this uh stage of you know puberty and the teen years you mentioned that kids of the that age still really need their parents um you know in the last gosh 20 30 years in this country there's been a market increase in the frequency of divorce um is there any direct evidence that single parent homes or homes where I don't know people are remarried or just basically divorced homes are somehow um creating more challenges in terms of risk-taking behavior in adolescence and teens or um or not because I know plenty of people who had you know grew up in single parent homes um sometimes parents remarried and sometimes didn't and I by my mind I can't seem to come up with any direct correlation you know plenty of uh those kids did fine and plenty of kids in two parent homes that I know had had challenges and and vice versa yeah I haven't contributed actually that was some my earlier dissertation work and I haven't really contributed to that literature for a while but what you're saying is is pretty accurate to what I've seen which is really the literature would say it's not the divorce per se it's the conflict that is happening so if parents actually get divorced usually if the conflict resumes teenagers and children generally do well and particularly within about two years if the conflict uh resolves if the conflict resolves right", 'Now you can look at your adult, counterparts, and indeed we should probably\nlook at ourselves and ask, you know did we learn\nproper play contingency when we were younger?\n\nDo we tend to take things too seriously?\n\nDo we tend to overreact aggressively when other people are clearly engaging in, you know, playful, jabbing or sarcasm or things of that sort.\n\nSo each of you will have a\ndifferent experience of this, but the point is that play\nserves many functions, it\'s not just about the self.\n\nIt\'s also about interactions\nbetween multiple people.\n\nIt\'s about rule testing and low stakes contingency rule breaking also\nserves an important role as is with the example\nof the "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting other puppies et cetera.\n\nAnd last but not least, there are different forms of play that help us establish who\nwe will become as adults.\n\nOne of the more powerful of these is role play when children\nand sometimes adults will take on different\nroles that are distinct from their natural world roles in order to for instance,\nestablish hierarchies.\n\nSo someone\'s going to be the leader and someone\'s going to be the follower.\n\nSomeone will be dominant.\n\nSomeone will be submissive.\n\nSomeone will work alone.\n\nOther people will work in a group.', "yeah so I think it's it's really I mean I'm I'm so I'm a parent I have two kids that are in public school and I think their Public Schools rated you know it's fine Buton say it's all right and um but but at their school they definitely do get education about um more holistic health and emotional regulation I think and and considering others um that's been that's that's a big focus of the school and I think that's actually really important I I I I mean you know again I'm I'm super biased from from my upbringing but my kids are going to learn math whenever it's time to learn the that they'll learn it whenever they need it you know whenever they need it they're going to learn it in a couple I don't know a couple weeks and figure out do the thing um most of the things that they learn they're going to forget them and then have to relearn them um so what are the things that you're going to really need to know no matter what you choose to do and I think regulating your your own emotions and and and engaging other individuals in a healthy sustainable way that you know and I mean sustainable in terms of the longevity of their relationships and I think those are the things that end up really mattering so I think um also this question about exposure to abundance and scarcity uh is really interesting too I mean I don't know if that's a direction we want to go into so please yeah well I think you know this whole you know it sort sounds sort of new Agy when I say you know abundant the abundance mindset", "so you know it is important to clean up the content but for kids going through puberty I think the only real answer is just delay just don't let them do that how much of the issue here is modeling of what adults are doing and um you know and how terrible are or good are adults at modulating their behavior I say modulating because you know I see a lot of parents um videotaping everything that they're you know on the phone all the time in line at the store while their kids are around you know and one of the reasons I think parents like divices so much is that it's a terrific uh lowc cost zero cost um babysitter it allows them to then go be on their phones or do other things yeah so young children are sometimes copying their parents young children are looking for things to copy uh and you know and so I I've got some slides in my regular book lecture of toy iPhones that we give to to ERS so they can be just like Mommy and Daddy um for little kids I think it might matter for teenagers you know I'm very often asked that question because and I think it's because parents they feel a little guilty like they know that they're modeling bad behavior and they're worried like is this setting up my kid for doing that and I can't say for sure but my intuition as a social psychologist is not really not very much and the reason is because you know while your kids once looked up to you and they once copied you like by the time they're 12 13 14", "Leveraging different kinds\nof social relationships that reinforce positive behavior.\n\nThis is starting to sound like\nkind of a boiler plate stuff.\n\nAnd yet, really the goal is during puberty to encourage as many\nsafe forms of interaction that allow children, teens,\nreally and adolescents, I keep calling them children, but what I mean are children\ngoing through puberty, that allow them to test\nthis thing of autonomy so that they can start\nto make good assessments about their exteroceptive\nevents that they are selecting and how those make them feel internally.\n\nSo they're essentially doing a buffet.\n\nThe buffet has now broadened to not just include the\nevents and experiences that their parents and\nother caretakers bring them, but they can now expand the buffet into things that they\ncan provide themselves.\n\nAnd so adolescence and puberty is really seen as the\nperiod of development in which one self-samples\nfor these two elements that we talked about at\nthe beginning, which are, how do I form bonds and how do I make predictions about what will make me feel good at a level of interoception.", "and it was that leap which is really uniquely human which is fully developed really throughout a very protracted period right little children do not fully appreciate those kinds of mental States yet right and in adolescence kids are all about trying to conjure and simulate these things and they do it very you know they overdo it and they do it in these very sort of awkward ways that adults recognize as uh you know uh not likely to correspond fully to reality right many times um and then we start to build more and more facility more and more sort of wisdom around Conjuring the story that makes the most direct parsimonious sense out of the things that you imagine somebody else may have experienced given the complexities of the context in which they find themselves it becomes more and more Dynamic more and more sort of inferential and so this also goes back to what you were saying about development this is actually how I see Development Across the lifespan my little two-year-old loves the arm then she loves me as much as something else that she really appreciates like daylight and then she goes on from there and when she's 80 God willing someday right", "so that's the third Norm is uh no uh is phonefree schools you have to lock up the phone in the morning either a lock in a phone lock or Yonder pouch um if the policy is you keep in your pocket that's not a policy that's just a recipe for constant conflict with the kids because they can't help it they have to text if anyone's texting they have to be texting and the fourth Norm is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real world because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing we have to do is restore a really fun adventurous childhood like you know what you were saying you know you go out on your bicycle you're hanging out with your friends friends sometimes something happens and boy you have memories I mean exciting things happen scary things happen you have memories and you know I worry about like what you know what boys today you know I have a group of Buddy my group of friends that I you know we we still talk about things that happened you know things that amazing things that happened when we were in college or after college and I wonder what boys young boys today are going to say you know you remember fortnite game 27363 where you were trapped in that Elevator Shaft and I had to shoot you out no I don't remember that one you know like uh the the virtual Adventures are just not going to cut it our kids need Adventure they need Independence and Adventure uh where they work out the conflicts themselves", 'So this is actually really\nimportant to understand that a baby, when you were a\nbaby, and when I was a baby, we didn\'t have any sense\nof the outside world except that it responded to our\nacts of anxiety essentially.\n\nNow this isn\'t Freudian theory, There are components of it that are embedded in Freudian theory, but all developmental\npsychologists agree that babies lack the ability to make cognitive sense\nof the outside world, but in this feeling of anxiety and registering one\'s own internal state, and then crying out to the outside world, either through crying\nor subtle vocalizations, or even just cuing, making some noise, we start to develop a relationship\nwith the outside world in which our internal states, our shifts and anxiety\nstart to drive requests, and people come and respond\nto those requests, hopefully.\n\nAnd the reason I say hopefully is that we\'ve all heard presumably about these cases of neglect.\n\nThere are a lot of cases\nwhere if you neglect a baby, you neglect an adolescent or a teenager, development doesn\'t go well, and we\'ll touch on some of those.\n\nBut those are really extreme cases.\n\nThey\'re sort of like the\nparallel to experiments that are often done in the\nlaboratory with animals, where you\'ve probably heard\nof these enriched environments where they\'ll give mice a bunch of toys, and they\'ll give them some different foods\nevery once in a while, and they\'ll house them\ntogether with other mice.\n\nAnd then what you find\nis that the animals, they will say, "Oh, their brain is thicker and their neurons have more\nbranches to them and all that."']

Ground Truths: ["The significance of real-world responsibility in children's development lies in restoring a fun and adventurous childhood, allowing children to engage in activities that foster independence and help them work out conflicts themselves. This real-world experience is essential for creating lasting memories and developing important life skills, as opposed to relying solely on virtual adventures."]

Answer: 

Several harmful changes have been associated with smartphone use, particularly among adolescents and young adults:

1. Sleep disruption: Increased smartphone use, especially before bedtime, can lead to sleep disturbances due to additional blue light exposure.

2. Reduced physical activity: Excessive smartphone use can lead to a more sedentary lifestyle and less time spent outdoors or in nature.

3. Attention deficits: Studies have shown that using smartphones for more than 60 minutes per day in adolescents can lead to significant difficulties in focusing and attending to tasks. For adults, this threshold may be around two hours per day.

4. Mental health issues: There's a correlation between increased smartphone use and rising rates of depression, particularly among girls in developed countries.

5. Social interaction changes: While smartphones can increase social connectivity, they can also lead to reduced face-to-face interactions. There are concerns about how this might affect social and physical development, especially in teenagers.

6. Cognitive exhaustion: Constant exposure to stimuli from other human minds through smartphones can lead to brain exhaustion and increased anxiety. This is referred to as "solitude deprivation," where individuals lack periods free from external mental stimuli.

7. Compulsive behavior: Smartphone use can develop into a compulsive habit, similar to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), where users feel compelled to check their devices frequently, even when it's not necessary.

8. Increased exposure to harmful content: Smartphones provide easier access to potentially risky behaviors and harmful content, including targeted marketing of products like e-cigarettes to young people.

9. Cyberbullying: The widespread use of smartphones has increased the potential for online bullying and the rapid spread of embarrassing or harmful content.

10. Distraction from important tasks: The constant presence of smartphones can make it difficult to focus on work, study, or other important activities.

It's important to note that while these harmful changes have been observed, the relationship between smartphone use and these effects is complex and can vary among individuals.

consolidation of learning and acceleration of learning we had the one negative effect which was the pavlovian connection to distraction the other I've written about before is Solitude deprivation right so so I'm using a different definition of solitude than the colloquial one most people think of it as a physical thing I'm I'm just isolated but there's a there's a cognitive psychological definition of solitude which means absence of stimuli created by other human Minds right so I'm not taking in information that's coming directly from another human mind uh having no period with this Solitude so having no period in your day where your free from stimuli creative from other Minds is Solitude deprivation and it's a real issue and partially it's a real issue because when we're processing input from another human brain it's all hands- on Deck right I mean we're very social beings a huge portion of our brain is dedicated to this right um so it's a very cognitively expensive activity when I'm trying to understand another human's what they're saying I'm simulating their mental state I'm trying to understand like where do they fall in this sort of social hierarchy and one of my arguments was um when you spend your entire day in that state it's exhausting and anxiety producing and like until we had smartphones and ubiquitous wireless internet the idea that you could banish all Solitude from your day is laughable it's just impossible right so of course we had a lot of portions of our day where our brain was not like ramped up in gear four like the sort of social processing mode but smartphones makes it possible that you can be in that mode all day long and so like one of the things I hypothesize is some of the anxiety Rises that goes with the age of smartphones is brain exhaustion right so that's like that's another negative effect of the const we have two negative effects now for the constant stimuli and one positive effect for the absence of the constant stimula so I think we're making a case here for not always being on your device", "There are some studies\nand one in particular that I'd like to highlight one was actually carried\nout pretty early in 2014.\n\nThis is a study that\nexplored smartphone use at the time they called\nit mobile phone use, but smartphone use and inattention, difficulties in attending\nin 7,102 adolescents that's a huge study, a population based cross-sectional study and you will be probably\nsurprised and somewhat dismayed to hear that in order\nto avoid this decrease in attentional capacity, adolescents needed to use their smartphone for less than 60 minutes per day, in order to stay focused and\ncentered on their other tasks.\n\nOtherwise they started to really run into significant issues.\n\nSo 60 minutes is not much, I've a feeling that most young people are using their phone more\nthan 60 minutes per day, I know I am.\n\nI think for adults, the number's probably higher\nmeaning if you're an adult, I'm going to just extrapolate\nfrom what I read in this study.\n\nIt seems that probably two\nhours a day on the phone would be the upper limit beyond which you would probably experience pretty severe attentional deficits.", "so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "so yes there is some evidence that overall phones and smartphones have increased risk behavior but it's more the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "so I I point to that it's that 5-year period 2010 to 2015 which I've called the Great rewiring of childhood because it affects everything everything about what children and teenagers are doing I can recall in 2010 I was actually in New York City visiting friends I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting yeah nowadays I think of it less as addicting but almost um like an an OCD of sorts and here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD but the interesting thing about OCD is that the compulsions the behaviors don't serve to reduce the obsessions rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them and in many ways I feel like smartphone use and social media use in particular is a OCD of sorts it's not just habit it's not just an addiction it's an obsessive compulsive Loop so it's already a struggle to pay attention and you know ancient Traditions have have taught techniques to improve your focus your attention we're easily distracted and um you know so I don't work on my phone very much because I I hate to type on the phone and and I'm always at a computer but even for me sitting at my computer as soon as the thinking gets hard as soon as if I'm writing if I'm doing something that requires concentration some little part of my brain says I wonder what the weather's going to be and I go check the weather or you know oh did I get any email I go check my I might check my email you know probably 40 50 times a day and I know that's terrible so the question is is it a compulsion where I feel pulled I have to check it or something bad will happen no it's more like imagine trying to do your work imagine trying to be a kid in school and you have on your desk in front of you you have your television set your record player a walkie talk to talk to your friends a guitar a painting set all array in front of you and your teacher is telling you about you know geometry what are you going to do probably one of these things and so I think the smartphone where a flip phone it's it's a tool you pull it out if you want to talk to someone then you put it away but the smartphone there's no reason to ever put it away talk to us about the scary statistics there's just no way around this yeah"]

Answer: 

Gambling addiction can have severe psychological effects on individuals, impacting various aspects of their mental health and behavior. 

One of the most significant psychological effects is the development of compulsive behavior. Gambling addicts often feel a strong urge to continue gambling despite negative consequences, similar to how individuals with other addictions feel compelled to engage in their addictive behavior. This compulsion can lead to a cycle where the addict feels bad when not gambling, driving them to return to the activity for temporary relief.

The addiction also affects cognitive processes, particularly through the mechanism of motivated reasoning. Gambling addicts often maintain a persistent belief that the next bet could be life-changing, even in the face of repeated losses. This cognitive distortion can be particularly dangerous, as it fuels hope that is frequently dashed, leading to emotional turmoil.

Emotionally, gambling addiction can cause significant distress. Addicts may experience feelings of shame, especially when their gambling has negatively impacted their family's finances. They may also suffer from anxiety and depression, particularly when not engaged in gambling activities. The addiction can lead to a state of emotional instability, where the individual feels most "themselves" only when gambling.

Behaviorally, gambling addiction can result in a narrowing of interests and activities. As the addiction progresses, individuals may lose interest in other aspects of life such as relationships, work, or hobbies. This narrowing of focus can further isolate the individual and exacerbate their addiction.

In severe cases, gambling addiction can lead to profound depression and even suicidal thoughts or behaviors. The constant cycle of hope and disappointment, combined with the potential for significant financial losses, can take a severe toll on an individual's mental health.

It's important to note that while gambling can be enjoyable for some, for addicts, it becomes a source of significant psychological distress and dysfunction. The addiction hijacks the brain's reward system, making it increasingly difficult for the individual to find pleasure or satisfaction in other activities.

While the information provided gives a good overview of the psychological effects, it's worth noting that a more comprehensive study would likely reveal additional nuances and effects not captured in these brief excerpts.

Ground Truths: ["The psychological effects of gambling addiction on individuals include feelings of shame, anxiety, and loneliness. Addicts may feel terrible about their situation, especially after spending their family's money, yet they experience temporary relief or pleasure when engaging in gambling. This creates a cycle of motivated reasoning and hopefulness that is often dashed, leading to further emotional distress."]

Answer: 

There have been recent legal efforts to protect parents who allow their children to engage in unsupervised outdoor play from child neglect claims. An organization called "Let Grow" has been working to address this issue. They have successfully advocated for laws in eight states that specifically state that allowing a child to play outside unsupervised cannot be used as evidence of child neglect.

These laws aim to counter the ambiguity in existing regulations that have led to situations where parents faced potential legal consequences for allowing their children independence. For example, there have been cases where concerned neighbors or passersby have called the police upon seeing children playing or running errands without adult supervision, leading to involvement from child protective services.

The purpose of these new laws is to prevent unnecessary interventions by child protective services and to support parents who want to give their children more independence. This legal protection is part of a broader effort to restore opportunities for children to engage in unsupervised play and develop important life skills.

It's important to note that while these laws provide some protection, they are not universal across all states. Parents should be aware of the specific laws and regulations in their area regarding children's unsupervised activities.

These legal efforts are a response to changing societal norms and increased concerns about child safety that have led to more restrictive parenting practices in recent decades. The goal is to strike a balance between ensuring child safety and allowing children the freedom to develop independence and resilience through unsupervised play.

of that this is insane um so we so law could help to put to to stop incentivizing helicopter parenting to provide uh uh more spaces that are safe for kids to play in not car zones um so the book has the exas generation the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "whatever but um but kids need to be out playing with each other especially Outdoors we evolved in savanas we evolved in different parts of the world we're attracted to Nature um so that's the way it it always was now uh especially if we in the 1950s and 60s America just been through a World War and the greatest way to make people trust each other the greatest way to boost social capital is a foreign attack and of course Pearl Harbor did more for American Co coherence than anything else in history in modern history 911 did that too but only for a little while and then we we lost it um so for a a lot of reasons people trusted their neighbors kids were out playing you know my parents grew up in the depression in New York City the kids were all out playing stickball on the street or in a parking lot in the 1970s there is a real crime wave um crime goes through the roof actually and it goes through the 80s that goes all the way to the early 90s even still you were kicked out of the house to go play um even in New York City all kids went out to play that's just the way it was but we begin to lose trust in each other for a lot of reasons Robert putam wrote about this in Bowling alone the the the the loss of Social Capital many reasons for that the changing media environment air conditioning and television people are not hanging out on their porch in the summertime to get away from the Heat they Clos the door and they put on the AC and they watch TV family sizes are shrinking there are not that many kids around so for a lot of reasons by the the 90s is the key decade where act two of the tragedy happens and that's the loss of the play-based childhood", "most Instagram no so it the the huge time suck is the videos so it's actually Tik Tok and YouTube are counted in this analysis they're counted as social media YouTube is marginally social media it's more of an general information Source but the point is especially the short videos the short videos are really really addictive because the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the house every day to go play my mom would say get out of the house I now realize she wanted space yeah", "but we just need a norm now for for raising the age to 16 we can struggle to do that I'm doing that with my kids I'm saying no for my daughter no Snapchat till you're 16 16 um and she's the only one who doesn't have it it's painful for her and she's 14 um but my hope is that no parent again will be in that situation that in every school a lot of the parents are going to say no no social media till 16 now of course the laws currently state that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract give away your data and make a deal with a company without your parents knowledge or permission but Congress passed this terrible law in 1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy protection act it was supposed to set the age to 16 which is not which is I think pretty reasonable but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement it's the law is written such that as long as the company doesn't absolutely know that you're underage they're fine they're not responsible 13 they're motivated the companies are now the law motivates the companies to not know how old children are there's barely any forbrain at 13 that's right that's right and since all you have to do you just have to be old enough to lie about your age if you're old enough to lie about your age you can go anywhere on the internet because there's no enforcement so I'm saying let's take the age of 13 which is not enforced let's require age verification which is complicated but they're working on that in Britain they've they're mandating that it's going to happen in Britain we'll work out the technical details um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's the one place where I think we really do need law uh because social media is a social trap and if half the kids are on it there's going to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws", "I love what your mom did getting you guys outside um my parents did the same thing too like we I was very blessed to have two parents who didn't come you know they didn't have a lot of resources growing up they didn't come to this country with a lot of resources but the one of the greatest gifts they G gave us is that they loved us uncondition Al the other great gift that they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out", "so in America and Britain we freaked out about child abduction and child sexual abuse um some of the scandals were real the Boy Scouts the Catholic Church there were cases where trusted organizations were covering up abuse and I recall the abduction thing the carton y thing right and there was a show I think my name is Brian you know about the kid who was abducted and then all he remembered I think it's a true story was that his name was Brian he would just remind himself every night about his real name you know I think they found him eventually in Berkeley mhm not calling out Berkeley I lived in Berkeley for a long time but um seemed to be the discovery of of Abu of abducted kid excuse me in Berkeley uh there are a few other cases there I don't know what that's about um in any of I grew up thinking that you could get kidnapped right yeah which yeah which is so it's I mean it's the most terrifying possibility for any parent um but when I was doing the research for the codling the American mind I found according to FBI statistics there's only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings a year in our whole country because if a child like who would take a child like it's a really difficult crime and you're going to you know who would steal a child from a store you know parents are afraid if your kid goes to the next D on the grocery store going to be how are you going to take a kicking and screaming kid out of a store um it's and yet sorry to interrupt but the show America's Most Wanted I believe was hosted by a guy whose kid was abducted and eventually found dead exactly Adam that's right right so so there was this propagation of this fear like that one of the deepest fears of any parent I can to imagine is is is that that's right but the point is that these crimes are extraordinarily rare it's almost always the non-custodial parent who takes a kid it's a family member because there's a fight within the family um so we fear the wrong things we're terrified of kidnapping um but locking our kids up overprotecting them has spiked the suicide rate so much that the death toll is vastly higher from the extra suicides than it would be if we could completely wipe out kidnapping which again doesn't", "so that's the third Norm is uh no uh is phonefree schools you have to lock up the phone in the morning either a lock in a phone lock or Yonder pouch um if the policy is you keep in your pocket that's not a policy that's just a recipe for constant conflict with the kids because they can't help it they have to text if anyone's texting they have to be texting and the fourth Norm is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real world because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing we have to do is restore a really fun adventurous childhood like you know what you were saying you know you go out on your bicycle you're hanging out with your friends friends sometimes something happens and boy you have memories I mean exciting things happen scary things happen you have memories and you know I worry about like what you know what boys today you know I have a group of Buddy my group of friends that I you know we we still talk about things that happened you know things that amazing things that happened when we were in college or after college and I wonder what boys young boys today are going to say you know you remember fortnite game 27363 where you were trapped in that Elevator Shaft and I had to shoot you out no I don't remember that one you know like uh the the virtual Adventures are just not going to cut it our kids need Adventure they need Independence and Adventure uh where they work out the conflicts themselves"]

Answer: 

Since the 1970s, anxiety and depression trends for girls and boys have shown significant changes, particularly in recent years. Here's an overview of how these trends have evolved:

1. 1970s to early 2010s:
- Anxiety and depression rates for both girls and boys remained relatively stable.
- The percentage of adolescents suffering from anxiety, depression, or self-harm was around 12-15%.
- Some measures even showed slight improvements during this period.

2. 2012 onwards for girls:
- A dramatic increase in anxiety and depression rates for girls began around 2012.
- The trend is described as a "hockey stick" graph, with a sharp uptick starting in 2012.
- This sudden increase is seen across multiple developed countries, not just in the United States.
- The rise in rates for girls is estimated to be between 50% to 150%, depending on the specific measure.

3. 2009/2010 onwards for boys:
- Boys also experienced an increase in anxiety and depression rates, but the trend differs from girls.
- The increase for boys began earlier, around 2009 or 2010.
- The trend for boys shows a more gradual, steady increase rather than a sudden spike.

4. Magnitude of increase:
- For most measures, the increase is close to a doubling of rates, especially for younger girls.
- Hospital admissions for self-harm and psychiatric emergency department visits show similar sharp upticks for girls.

5. Global trend:
- Similar patterns are observed across developed countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Scandinavian countries.

It's important to note that while boys have also experienced increased rates of anxiety and depression, the trend for girls is more pronounced and sudden. The data comes from various annual or biannual surveys and hospital records, providing a comprehensive view of these mental health trends over time.

Retrieved Contexts: ["but it's nothing compared to what it is today so the lines are pretty flat until around 2012 and then all of a sudden the lines for girls go up like a hockey stick it's not a subtle thing it really is there's an elbow it's like somebody turned on a light switch in 2012 um now that's for the American data um internationally you see very similar things it's not necessarily 2012 in other countries but the girls graphs are very sharp the boys are also up on depression anxiety they're also way up depending on the measure it's usually everything is in the ballpark of 50 to 150% almost all the numbers are in that range um we're not talking 10 or 20% increases here for most things we're talking close to a doubling especially for the younger girls the boys curves interestingly are smoother that is the boys are more depressed and anxious it's but it's not 2012 it it actually often begins begins more like 2009 2010 and then it just keeps going up gradually so that that's a real clue um which we'll come back when we talk about the the boy story um it a lot of people say oh you know it's just self-report um you know just gen Z they're really they're really um positive about mental health and they're willing to talk about it's a good thing", "and we will talk about Solutions you offer some incredible Solutions in the book actually solutions that everyone listening and watching can participate in not just by restriction and we'll talk about what that means uh going forward but where are we at now and when did we start to see the trend toward diminish mental health in particular in girls yeah so feel free to hit us with the with the scary truth okay sure so let's imagine so in the US we have really good statistics based on annual or biannual surveys there's three or four big ones that allow us to see what's happened since the 70s and so what I'd like listeners to imagine is imagine a bunch of lines maybe a line for boys maybe a line a line for boys line for girls showing the percentage that suffer from anxiety depression or that have self harm those three really go together and imagine these lines they move around a little bit but they're actually pretty stable from the 1990s all the way through 2010 even 2011 there's no sign of a problem on some measures they're getting actually a little bit better because stable and low stable well low you know if it's if they're around say 12 15 % of girls qualify as having had a major depression you know that's much higher than we would like um that's a problem", "but there's this whole category of jokes like um you know when joaco was born um the doctor looked at his mother and said it's a man you know or or when jao left for college he looked at his father and said you're the man of the house now you know jokes like that you know there are tons and tons of these right so there's this whole so that's very YouTube male type humor it's it's one hit it's done it gets a ton of likes and it propagates yeah none of this two or three chess moves down the down the road um so it's very clapback sometimes in or in that case building up Joo who doesn't need any more building up but people do it anyway so things of that sort so interested in the in these um in the Nuance here because um you're telling me that girls are killing themselves more they're depressed their increase in suicide is larger boys have a much higher suicide rate so boy many more boys die from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or a bridge whereas girls tend to use pills or cutting their wrists and they and the great majority of girl suicide attempts don't lead to death yeah so are most of the issues with girls and online use social media it's sort of um uh it's despair it's at home anxious sad about self self- critiquing this kind of thing I mean you're telling me there's a a huge and I believe you that there's a tremendous increase I mean he said hockey stick like function um when we're looking at essentially capturing the tip of the p pyramid in terms of like extreme social interaction so take let me I'm not being very very clear here we have these neural circuits that evolved for social interactions that are more heightened in girls they're getting much more of it faster yeah and the consequences are no less and probably even more severe than they used to be", "so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "but the fact that we see the exact same curves the very sharp uptick for girls um in Hospital admissions for self harm psychiatric emergency Department visits and we see this in the US Canada Australia New Zealand uh the UK um the Scandinavian countries so something happened across the developed World um around 2012 and I keep you know Jee twangy was the first to really raise the alarm she and I keep saying well you know we can't find another candidate nothing else fits the

Answer: 

Unstructured play Fridays for kids offer numerous benefits for their development and well-being:

1. Social skills development: Unstructured play time allows children to learn crucial social skills. They practice negotiating situations with other kids, resolving conflicts, and recognizing non-verbal cues in others. This helps them develop collaboration and interpersonal skills that are essential for their future.

2. Mental health benefits: Free play time contributes positively to children's mental health. It provides a break from the pressures of structured activities and allows for creativity, reflection, and spontaneous interactions with peers.

3. Real-world problem-solving: When children engage in unstructured play, they encounter real-world situations that require problem-solving. This helps them develop critical thinking skills and adaptability.

4. Nervous system development: Unstructured play supports the natural development of a child's nervous system. The diversity of interactions and experiences during free play is crucial for healthy brain development.

5. Independence and responsibility: Allowing children to have unstructured play time fosters independence and a sense of responsibility. They learn to make decisions, manage their time, and navigate various situations on their own.

6. Creativity and exploration: Free play encourages creativity and allows children to explore their interests without the constraints of organized activities. This can lead to discovering new passions and developing a sense of curiosity about the world around them.

7. Stress relief: In contrast to the highly structured lives many children lead today, unstructured play provides a much-needed outlet for stress and allows kids to relax and enjoy themselves.

8. Formation of memories and experiences: Unstructured play often leads to memorable experiences that children can reflect on and learn from as they grow older. These real-world adventures contribute to their personal growth and identity formation.

9. Balance to digital experiences: In an age where many children spend significant time on digital devices, unstructured play in the real world offers a crucial counterbalance, promoting physical activity and face-to-face social interactions.

It's important to note that while unstructured play is valuable, it should be implemented in a way that ensures children's safety while still allowing for exploration and independence. The benefits of unstructured play highlight the need to reconsider the highly structured and digitally focused lifestyles many children currently experience.

the one of the greatest gifts they G gave us is that they loved us uncondition Al the other great gift that they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out", "but I worry that right now that we've almost somehow made that kind of unstructured time seem inefficient you know we've set these standards uh for our kids that they need to be uh you know getting fancy jobs and into fancy colleges and making an x amount of money and the path to doing that is you know to be enrolled in X number of activities after school and to do all this stuff in school and their lives are so hyper structured um that I worry that the time to just play to be creative to reflect and think to just have unstructured time with other kids has evaporated and I think that that also is hurting the mental health and wellbeing of our children I love the idea that that unstructured play time could be framed in the accurate context of the nervous system developing the way it was supposed to develop I mean I would argue that um success is going to be easiest for children that engage in the real world more in fact there's great risk to posting everything that you do online we've seen some examples of that preventing people from getting into or staying in college based on things they said or did previously that they shouldn't have said or done um that's those are kind of you know negative highlighted

do in life, but as children, most all of us engage in a lot of play.\n\nAnd in looking at the way\nthat very young children and especially toddlers play, we can learn a lot because it reveals the fundamental rules by which the toddler brain\ninteracts with the world.", "I mean it's crazy what happens so eight states have now said no no more of that this is insane um so we so law could help to put to to stop incentivizing helicopter parenting to provide uh uh more spaces that are safe for kids to play in not car zones um so the book has the exas generation the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "Play is something that\nnormally we associate with children's games and indeed with being a child, much of our childhood\ndevelopment centers around play, whether or not it's organized play or spontaneous play, but as adults, we also need to play.\n\nAnd today I'm going to talk about what I like to refer to\nas The Power of Play.\n\nThe Power of Play,\nresides in plays ability to change our nervous system for the better, so that we can perform many activities, not just play activities, better.\n\nPlay can also function as a way to explore new ways of being in different scenarios in work, in relationships, in settings of all kind, and indeed also in the\nrelationship to oneself.\n\nIn fact, we are going to explore how\nassuming different identities during the same game of play or the same forms of play has been shown to be immensely powerful for allowing people to engage in more creative thinking and dynamic thinking and\nindeed to better leaders and more effective workers and students and learners\nand happier people.", "so that's the third Norm is uh no uh is phonefree schools you have to lock up the phone in the morning either a lock in a phone lock or Yonder pouch um if the policy is you keep in your pocket that's not a policy that's just a recipe for constant conflict with the kids because they can't help it they have to text if anyone's texting they have to be texting and the fourth Norm is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real world because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing we have to do is restore a really fun adventurous childhood like you know what you were saying you know you go out on your bicycle you're hanging out with your friends friends sometimes something happens and boy you have memories I mean exciting things happen scary things happen you have memories and you know I worry about like what you know what boys today you know I have a group of Buddy my group of friends that I you know we we still talk about things that happened you know things that amazing things that happened when we were in college or after college and I wonder what boys young boys today are going to say you know you remember fortnite game 27363 where you were trapped in that Elevator Shaft and I had to shoot you out no I don't remember that one you know like uh the the virtual Adventures are just not going to cut it our kids need Adventure they need Independence and Adventure uh where they work out the conflicts themselves"]

Ground Truths: ['The perks of having unstructured play Fridays for kids include the opportunity to have fun experiences without the constraints of scheduled activities like piano lessons. It fosters trust in kids to sort things out and be safe, as statistics suggest they are more likely to thrive under these conditions than to face dangers. Additionally, it merges concepts from previous and current books, promoting a balance between freedom and safety.']

Answer: 

The evolving hierarchy in Seal Team squadrons significantly enhances their effectiveness and safety in ways that are markedly different from online interactions. 

In Seal Teams, there's a concept called "dynamic subordination" where leadership roles shift based on the skills required for a particular situation. This allows the most competent person to take charge when their expertise is needed, regardless of formal rank. This flexibility enables the team to adapt quickly and leverage each member's strengths.

The hierarchy in Seal Teams is also characterized by decentralized command. Leaders exist at every level of the organization, and team members are empowered to make decisions and take initiative when necessary. This structure fosters resilience and adaptability, as team members can act independently while still working towards common goals.

Another crucial aspect of the Seal Team hierarchy is the culture of constructive criticism. Team members are "relentlessly hard on each other" through humor and direct feedback. This creates an environment where continuous improvement is the norm, and mistakes or weaknesses are addressed openly to enhance overall team performance and safety.

In contrast, online interactions often lack this dynamic and supportive structure. Online, hierarchies can be more rigid and based on factors like follower count rather than situational competence. The fear of public criticism or "dog piling" can inhibit open communication and honest feedback. Unlike the safe space created in Seal Teams where mistakes are learning opportunities, online environments can feel like "thin ice" where one misstep can lead to severe consequences.

The evolving hierarchy in Seal Teams creates a balance between structure and flexibility, fostering trust among team members. This trust allows individuals to both step up when needed and step back to let others lead, enhancing overall effectiveness and safety. Online interactions, however, often lack this level of trust and dynamic role-shifting, potentially limiting collaboration and growth.

In summary, the Seal Team model of hierarchy promotes adaptability, resilience, and continuous improvement in high-stakes environments. This stands in stark contrast to many online interactions, where rigid structures and fear of criticism can hinder effective collaboration and personal growth.

very non-scientific way you know the number of presidents that's often old oldest or only children this type of thing it's it's a loose correlation there's a lot of other reasons why it might not be

assuming a certain role and that attractor state deepens with more time spent there I find that so fascinating I've also observed and I think I've seen a few papers on I don't know how rigorous these papers are that um youngest or let's just say not oldest siblings um here we're setting aside single children that don't have any siblings but that youngest siblings uh do tend to quote unquote break the mold more in terms of uh socio and cultural norms of the family they they Venture further in terms of um experiences and systems they're often seen as having had fewer constraints than the older sibling which may or may not be true um but that the youngest uh siblings often will um take on risk yeah that older siblings won't yeah yeah yeah and that's certainly been my observation nonconformists right I mean I'm a young younger brother of an older sister um but and then but then there was times in our childhood where she was out of the house and I was at home just with my mom so so that sort of changes things but and it's very Dynamic I realize we're playing here in in a kind of a loose space but but I find Social rank stuff to be super interesting I grew up in a big pack of mostly boys um that's just kind of how it worked out in my neighborhood um at the time um and it was very interesting because it was very clear it was a dynamic hierarchy where if we were skateboarding certain kids were Alpha if we were playing soccer other kids were Alpha if we were doing anything artistic um if it was uh kind of geeky knowledge and and nerdy stuff um you know then you know might have been somebody else who had the knowledge um and had the information that people wanted so I think Dynamic hierarchies are really interesting and I think um get us out of that sort of more standard Alpha like kind of chest beating telling everyone what to do dictatorial model I mean and this is now fully out of any science land and into speculation opinion land but I think that type of structural structure where when you're doing different tasks different individuals become the the alpha or the leader because it's based on competence is very healthy"]

Ground Truths: ["The evolving hierarchy in Seal Team squadrons enhances effectiveness and safety through the concept of Dynamic subordination, where individuals take over leadership roles based on their skill sets as needed. This allows for a supportive environment where members can step up or rest, fostering trust in each other's abilities. In contrast, online interactions are often fear-based, where individuals worry about being criticized or 'dog piled' for their comments, leading to a sense of danger and caution rather than the safety and camaraderie found in close friendships."]

Answer: 

The anxiety and depression statistics reveal a concerning trend in mental health among girls since the 1970s. From the 1990s through 2010-2011, the rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm among girls were relatively stable and low. During this period, approximately 12-15% of girls qualified as having had a major depression, which was considered problematic but manageable.

However, a dramatic shift occurred around 2012. The statistics for girls show a sharp uptick, often described as a "hockey stick" pattern on graphs. This sudden increase was not subtle; it was as if someone had "turned on a light switch" in 2012. The rise in mental health issues for girls was steep and significant, with most measures showing increases in the range of 50% to 150%. In many cases, the rates nearly doubled, especially for younger girls.

This trend is not limited to self-reported data. Similar patterns are observed in hospital admissions for self-harm and psychiatric emergency department visits. Importantly, this phenomenon is not unique to one country but is seen across the developed world, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavian countries.

In contrast, while boys also experienced increases in depression and anxiety, their trend line was different. For boys, the increase began earlier, around 2009-2010, and showed a more gradual, continuous rise rather than the sharp uptick seen in girls.

It's worth noting that these statistics represent a significant departure from the previous decades of relative stability, indicating a major shift in the mental health landscape for young people, particularly girls, since 2012.

things we're talking close to a doubling especially for the younger girls the boys curves interestingly are smoother that is the boys are more depressed and anxious it's but it's not 2012 it it actually often begins begins more like 2009 2010 and then it just keeps going up gradually so that that's a real clue um which we'll come back when we talk about the the boy story um it a lot of people say oh you know it's just self-report um you know just gen Z they're really they're really um positive about mental health and they're willing to talk about it's a good thing", "so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "but the fact that we see the exact same curves the very sharp uptick for girls um in Hospital admissions for self harm psychiatric emergency Department visits and we see this in the US Canada Australia New Zealand uh the UK um the Scandinavian countries so something happened across the developed World um around 2012 and I keep you know Jee twangy was the first to really raise the alarm she and I keep saying well you know we can't find another candidate nothing else fits the pattern oh and there's actually not just correlational data there's experiment experimental data too", "but there's this whole category of jokes like um you know when joaco was born um the doctor looked at his mother and said it's a man you know or or when jao left for college he looked at his father and said you're the man of the house now you know jokes like that you know there are tons and tons of these right so there's this whole so that's very YouTube male type humor it's it's one hit it's done it gets a ton of likes and it propagates yeah none of this two or three chess moves down the down the road um so it's very clapback sometimes in or in that case building up Joo who doesn't need any more building up but people do it anyway so things of that sort so interested in the in these um in the Nuance here because um you're telling me that girls are killing themselves more they're depressed their increase in suicide is larger boys have a much higher suicide rate so boy many more boys die from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or a bridge whereas girls tend to use pills or cutting their wrists and they and the great majority of girl suicide attempts don't lead to death yeah so are most of the issues with girls and online use social media it's sort of um uh it's despair it's at home anxious sad about self self- critiquing this kind of thing I mean you're telling me there's a a huge and I believe you that there's a tremendous increase I mean he said hockey stick like function um when we're looking at essentially capturing the tip of the p pyramid in terms of like extreme social interaction so take let me I'm not being very very clear here we have these neural circuits that evolved for social interactions that are more heightened in girls they're getting much more of it faster yeah and the consequences are no less and probably even more severe than they used to be", "Also, it's very clear that\ndepression increases over time and especially, this is surprising to me, but especially for individuals\nthat were not depressed at the the outset of their use.\n\nIn other words, they\ndidn't start using cannabis because they were depressed, but rather the depression starts to emerge as a consequence of the\ncannabis and THC use.\n\nSo that's serious, in fact, we now know, based on really solid\nepidemiological evidence, that depression is not a strong predictor of seeking out cannabis.\n\nIt doesn't drive terribly many people to seek out cannabis use, but cannabis use, itself, makes\npeople four times likelier to develop a chronic major depression.\n\nSo anxiety is increasing,\ndepression is increasing, and this turns out to\nbe especially relevant and important to young people.\n\nWhy do I say that?\n\nWell, if you look at the data, and again, I think some\nof the strongest data are data to come out\nof the Canadian system.\n\nThey've done some really\nbeautiful controlled studies.\n\nI really hope to invite some of the people who arranged and ran those studies as guests onto the Huberman Lab Podcast."]

Ground Truths: ['The anxiety and depression statistics reveal that from the 1970s to the early 2010s, the percentage of girls suffering from anxiety, depression, or self-harm has been relatively stable, with no significant signs of a problem during that period. In fact, some measures indicated that the situation was getting a little better, although the rates of major depression among girls were still concerning, with around 12-15% qualifying as having had a major depression.']

Answer: 

Unaccompanied children playing outside without adult supervision face several challenges in today's society:

1. Legal risks: In some areas, allowing children to play unsupervised can be interpreted as child neglect. There have been cases where parents faced legal consequences for letting their children play outside alone. For example, if an 8-year-old is seen unaccompanied at a store, concerned neighbors might call the police, leading to involvement from child protective services.

2. Societal mistrust: There's a general loss of trust among neighbors and communities, which has led to a decrease in children playing freely outside. This mistrust can result in increased scrutiny of unaccompanied children and potentially unnecessary interventions.

3. Lack of opportunities: Due to changing social norms and parental fears, children have fewer chances to engage in unsupervised play. This limits their opportunities for independence, adventure, and natural social interactions with peers.

4. Overprotection: The fear of rare events like child abduction has led to overprotection, which paradoxically may increase other risks. For instance, the suicide rate among young people has increased, potentially due in part to lack of independence and free play.

5. Reduced skill development: Unsupervised play is crucial for children to learn important life skills such as conflict resolution, negotiation, collaboration, and reading social cues. The lack of these experiences can hinder their social and emotional development.

6. Limited physical activity: With fewer opportunities for free outdoor play, children may not get enough physical activity, which is essential for their health and development.

7. Increased screen time: As a consequence of reduced outdoor play, children are spending more time on screens and social media, which can have negative impacts on their mental health and overall well-being.

It's important to note that while these challenges exist, the actual risks of serious harm (such as abduction) during unsupervised play are extremely low. The FBI statistics mentioned in the context indicate only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings per year in the entire United States, most of which involve family members rather than strangers.

To address these challenges, some organizations are advocating for a return to play-based childhoods and working to change laws to protect parents who allow their children more independence. The goal is to restore a balance that allows children to experience the benefits of unsupervised play while ensuring their safety.

social capital is a foreign attack and of course Pearl Harbor did more for American Co coherence than anything else in history in modern history 911 did that too but only for a little while and then

kicked out of the house to go play um even in New York City all kids went out to play that's just the way it was but we begin to lose trust in each other for a lot of reasons Robert putam wrote about this in Bowling alone the the the the loss of Social Capital many reasons for that the changing media environment air conditioning and television people are not hanging out on their porch in the

it's more of an general information Source but the point is especially the short videos the short videos are really really addictive because the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the house every day to go play my mom would say get out of

the other great gift that they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out", "I mean it's crazy what happens so eight states have now said no no more of that this is insane um so we so law could

it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "look you guys actually you can see what this is doing to you you mostly agree that this is wasting your time it's garbage you you want to way out but you just feel like you can't there's such resignation um but look the cool kids over there they have flip phones and they're out like every day after school they're like you know they're doing stuff they're down at you know they're in the mall they're they're getting pizza they're you know building a fort uh you know whatever depending on the age um so I think the way out is to give kids an exciting childhood kids are so lonely now and and they they don't have much in the way of Adventure they don't have much in the way of Thrills um you know you know I live I live in New York City um you know I would start I would like bring my kids out to Coney Island when they were you know 9 10 years old bring them out and then I would just say I'm just going to sit here you guys run around you guys go have fun like I'm not going to be with you you know you know yeah there's a chance you'll get kidnapped or struck by lightning

friend so um that's cool", "so that's the third Norm is uh no uh is phonefree schools you have to lock up the phone in the morning either a lock in a phone lock or Yonder pouch um if the policy is you keep in your pocket that's not a policy that's just a recipe for constant conflict with the kids because they can't help it they have to text if anyone's texting they have to be texting and the fourth Norm is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real world because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing we have to do is restore a really fun adventurous childhood like you know what you were saying you know you go out on your bicycle you're hanging out with your friends friends sometimes something happens and boy you have memories I mean exciting things happen scary things happen you have memories and you know I worry about like what you know what boys today you know I have a group of Buddy my group of friends that I you know we we still talk about things that happened you know things that amazing things that happened when we were in college or after college and I wonder what boys young boys today are going to say you know you remember fortnite game 27363 where you were trapped in that Elevator Shaft and I had to shoot you out no I don't remember that one you know like uh the the virtual Adventures are just not going to cut it our kids need Adventure they need Independence and Adventure uh where they work out the conflicts themselves", "so in America and Britain we freaked out about child abduction and child sexual abuse um some of the scandals were real the Boy Scouts the Catholic Church there were cases where trusted organizations were covering up abuse and I recall the abduction thing the carton y thing right and there was a show I think my name is Brian you know about the kid who was abducted and then all he remembered I think it's a true story was that his name was Brian he would just remind himself every night about his real name you know I think they found him eventually in Berkeley mhm not calling out Berkeley I lived in Berkeley for a long time but um seemed to be the discovery of of Abu of abducted kid excuse me in Berkeley uh there are a few other cases there I don't know what that's about um in any of I grew up thinking that you could get kidnapped right yeah which yeah which is so it's I mean it's the most terrifying possibility for any parent um but when I was doing the research for the codling the American mind I found according to FBI statistics there's only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings a year in our whole country because if a child like who would take a child like it's a really difficult crime and you're going to you know who would steal a child from a store you know parents are afraid if your kid goes to the next D on the grocery store going to be how are you going to take a kicking and screaming kid out of a store um it's and yet sorry to interrupt but the show America's Most Wanted I believe was hosted by a guy whose kid was abducted and eventually found dead exactly Adam that's right right so so there was this propagation of this fear like that one of the deepest fears of any parent I can to imagine is is is that that's right but the point is that these crimes are extraordinarily rare it's almost always the non-custodial parent who takes a kid it's a family member because there's a fight within the family um so we fear the wrong things we're terrified of kidnapping um but locking our kids up overprotecting them has spiked the suicide rate so much that the death toll is vastly higher from the extra suicides than it would be if we could completely wipe out kidnapping which again doesn't"]

Answer: 

Compulsive behavior can have significant effects on individuals' lives and social interactions. One of the most notable impacts is on time management. People with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often spend a considerable amount of time engaged in their compulsive behaviors or preoccupied with intrusive thoughts. This can severely limit their ability to participate in normal daily activities such as work, school, or social interactions.

The intrusive nature of obsessions and compulsions can make it difficult for individuals to focus on other aspects of their lives. As Dr. Huberman explains in his podcast, people with OCD may struggle to concentrate on tasks or engage in conversations because their minds are constantly occupied with their obsessive thoughts or the need to perform compulsive actions.

Compulsive behavior can also significantly impact an individual's psychosocial functioning and overall quality of life. Studies have shown that both people with OCD and those with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder experience impairments in these areas. This can manifest as difficulties in maintaining relationships, performing well at work, or engaging in leisure activities.

The intrusive and recurrent nature of obsessions in OCD can make it challenging for individuals to find relief or satisfaction in their environment. For example, someone with contamination-related OCD might never feel that a space is clean enough, leading to excessive cleaning behaviors that interfere with other aspects of their life.

It's important to note the distinction between OCD and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. While both can impact an individual's life, OCD is characterized by intrusive thoughts and behaviors that significantly disrupt daily functioning across various domains. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, on the other hand, may sometimes enhance functioning in certain areas, such as work or home organization, although it can still cause difficulties in relationships and overall life satisfaction.

In social interactions, compulsive behaviors can create barriers. Individuals may struggle to engage fully in conversations or activities due to their preoccupation with their obsessions or the need to perform compulsions. This can lead to misunderstandings, strained relationships, and social isolation.

Overall, compulsive behavior can have far-reaching effects on an individual's life, impacting their ability to function effectively in personal, professional, and social spheres. The time-consuming nature of compulsions, coupled with the distress caused by intrusive thoughts, can significantly reduce the quality of life and limit opportunities for personal growth and fulfilling relationships.

Retrieved Contexts: ["The other thing is that\nOCD takes a lot of time out of people's lives.\n\nWith recurrent intrusive\nthoughts happening at very high frequency, or\neven at moderate frequency,

the street, the obsessions are so\nintrusive that they show up and they compel people to\ndo things in that domain independent of whether or not they happen to be in\none location or another.\n\nIn other words, the thought patterns and the behaviors take\nover the environment as opposed to the environment driving the thought\npatterns and behaviors.\n\nSo it therefore becomes impossible to ever find a room that's clean enough, to find a bed that's made well enough, to find anything that's done well enough to remove the obsession.\n\nAnd I know I've said\nit multiple times now, but I'm going to say it many\ntimes throughout this episode in a somewhat obsessive, but I believe justified way that every time that one\nengages in the compulsion related to the obsession, the obsession simply

obsessive compulsive\ndisorder is very intrusive.\n\nIt involves intrusive thoughts and it interrupts with\nnormal functioning in life.\n\nWhereas obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder, while it can interrupt\nnormal functioning in life, it also can be productive.\n\nIt can enhance functioning\nin life, not just in work, but perhaps at home as well.\n\nIf you are somebody and\nyou have family members that really place enormous value on having a beautiful and highly organized home, well, then it could lend\nitself well to that.", "For instance, one of the\nthings that makes OCD so debilitating is, of course, the shame that we talked about before.\n\nBut it's also the fact that\nwhen people are focusing on their obsessions and their compulsions, they're not able to focus on other things.\n\nThat's simply the way\nthat the brain works.\n\nWe're not able to focus on\ntoo many things at once.", "Let's talk about OCD or\nobsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nFirst of all, as the name suggests, OCD includes thoughts or obsessions and compulsions which are actions.\n\nThe obsessions and the\ncompulsions are often linked.\n\nIn fact, most of the time, the obsessions and the\ncompulsions are linked such that the compulsion, the behavior, is designed to relieve the obsession.\n\nHowever, one of the hallmark themes of obsessive-compulsive disorder is that the obsessions are intrusive.\n\nPeople don't want to have them.\n\nThey don't enjoy having them.\n\nThey just seem to pop into people's minds and they seem to pop into\ntheir mind recurrently.\n\nAnd the compulsions, unlike\nother sorts of behaviors, provide brief relief to the obsession, but then very quickly reinforce\nor strengthen the obsession.\n\nThis is a very key theme to realize about obsessive-compulsive disorder so I'm just going to repeat it again.\n\nThese two features, first,\nthe fact that the obsessions are intrusive and recurrent, as well as the fact that the\ncompulsions, the behaviors, provide, if anything, only\nbrief relief for the obsessions, but in most cases simply serve to make the obsessions stronger\nare the hallmark features of obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nAnd it turns out to be very important to keep these in mind as we go forward, not just because they define\nobsessive-compulsive disorder, but they also define\nthe sorts of treatments that will and will not work for obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "but when our judgment is consistently sort of puts us at risk that's where we have something like OCD but OCD is also you know it's one of many conditions that suffer from these kinds of problems we tend to label them because they tend to present in a consistent way so we have patients with OCD that have hyper checking Behavior or contamination Behavior where they if they feel contaminated they'll wash their hands for hours repeatedly or if they drop their toothbrush on the floor this will lead to a compulsive behavior of cleaning a toothbrush or brushing your teeth consistently very very common symptoms that we see or signs that the patients report to us or or that we observe but you know patients with eating disorders they tend to if if they have binging disorder they'll overeat if they have bulimia they might Purge despite the risk of these things and so um addiction is is similar", "And then once you understand a little bit about the neural circuitry underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder, which we'll talk about in a few moments, then you will clearly understand why being a quote-unquote,\nobsessive person or having obsessive-compulsive personality is not the same as OCD.\n\nIn fact, we can leap ahead a little bit and compare and contrast OCD with obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder along one very particular set of features.\n\nAgain, I'll go into this\nin more detail later, but it's fair to say\nthat OCD is characterized by these recurrent and\nintrusive obsessions.\n\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nthe fact that those obsessions get stronger as a function of people performing certain behaviors.\n\nSo unlike an itch that you feel, and then you scratch\nit and it feels better, OCD is more like an itch that\nyou feel, you scratch it, and the itch intensifies.\n\nThat contour or that pattern of behaviors and thoughts interacting is very different than obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder, which mainly involves a sense\nof delayed gratification that people want and somewhat enjoy because it allows them to

and that's the reason when people talk about repetition compulsions you know that's it's not a formal term because because what we're really talking about is repetition right and we're interested like why why do we repeat things now that's one that's one reason right because we bring an unhealthy set of defenses and then at the end of the day things come out the same because we're bringing an unhealthy set of defenses right there can be other motivations that are related to all of that and there's again this complexity to it but but the compulsion part can be that we can re-enter situations that didn't go well with the idea that we're gonna we're gonna fix what happened in the past we're going to make ourselves feel better we're going to take away the mark of trauma because remember trauma doesn't care about the clock or the calendar so that's why you'll see someone who has had say five abusive relationships that looked very much the same right and is about to enter the sixth right and he said it's not because hopefully in most cases not because that person like wants to be hurt right I mean sometimes it's a different problem right but but there can be a drive inside

model\nof the balance in mind, I think it gives people\nkind of a way to imagine what they're experiencing\non a neuro-biological level, and understand it.\n\nAnd in that understanding,\nget some mastery over it, which is really what this is all about.\n\nBecause ultimately we do\nneed to disengage, right?\n\nWe can't live in that\nspace all the time, right.\n\nWe have other things we need to

Ground Truths: ["Compulsive behavior, such as addiction to activities like gambling, can lead to significant negative effects on individuals' lives, including feelings of shame, loneliness, and anxiety. Individuals may feel terrible about their situation, especially if they have spent their family's money, yet they may seek temporary relief through the addictive activity. This behavior can also result in a shift in social interactions, as individuals may move their social lives onto platforms like video games, porn, or social media, leading to increased loneliness despite the availability of cheap and easy stimulation, which ultimately is not satisfying."]

Answer: 

A 'super stimulus' in the context of food refers to highly processed or engineered foods that are designed to be exceptionally appealing to our senses and reward systems, often beyond what we would encounter in nature. These foods typically combine multiple intense flavors, textures, and nutrient profiles in a way that strongly activates our brain's reward pathways, particularly the dopamine system.

The term 'super stimulus' implies that these foods provide a more potent stimulation of our sensory and reward systems than natural, whole foods. For example, a cheeseburger with a milkshake that has candy in it is described as a "dopamine bath" due to its combination of fat, sugar, and other sensory stimuli like music and toys (in the case of fast food restaurants).

These super stimuli can have significant effects on our behavior. They can:

1. Increase cravings and desire for more of the same or similar foods
2. Shift our dopamine system to make us believe that only these highly palatable foods can trigger our reward system and make us feel good
3. Change our perception of taste, making less processed or natural foods seem less appealing in comparison
4. Lead to overconsumption, as these foods can override our natural satiety signals

Importantly, these super stimuli foods are often designed to exploit our evolutionary adaptations. Our brains evolved to seek out energy-dense foods for survival, but in our modern environment with abundant processed foods, this can lead to overconsumption and potential health issues.

The concept of super stimulus is related to the idea of "hijacking" our natural reward circuits. As Dr. Charles Zuker mentions, highly processed foods are "co-opting these circuits in a way that it would've never happened in nature," leading us to find these foods not just palatable but continuously reinforcing our desire for them.

Understanding the concept of super stimulus in food can help explain why some people struggle with maintaining a balanced diet and why certain foods can be so addictive. It also highlights the importance of being aware of how our food environment can influence our eating behaviors.

Retrieved Contexts: ['If you want to learn\nmore about food reward and food reinforcement, \'cause it turns out, those\nare slightly different things, there\'s a wonderful review\nwritten by Ivan de Araujo.\n\nThey have a middle author,\nMark Schachter, and Dana Small.\n\nIt\'s called "Rethinking Food Reward", and it was published in the\n"Annual Reviews of Psychology".\n\nYou can find it very easily online.\n\nIt was published in 2019.\n\nAnd it\'s a beautiful, deep dive, although, quite accessible to most people, about how different foods, and the way that we perceive them impacts our brain and body, and why we like the things we like, and how to reshape what we like.\n\nSo once again, we\'ve done a\nfairly extensive deep dive into food and your brain, focusing first on how particular foods and compounds within foods that are available also\nthrough supplementation can impact immediate and\nlong-term brain health.\n\nCame up with a relatively short list of what I would call super foods, only because there are\nample data to support their role in enhancing short\nand long-term cognition, and neuronal health, and so on.', "Again, this is not to take away from some of the beautiful data emphasizing that certain foods, and micronutrients, et cetera, are better for us, or worse\nfor us, and for the planet.\n\nThat's not a debate I want\nto get into right now.\n\nWhat this emphasizes, is that foods impact our\nbrain and its health, but they also impact\nhow our brain functions and responds to food, and that is largely a learned response.\n\nWe can't completely\noverride, for instance, that certain foods evoke a\nstrong, [grunts] yuck component.\n\nCertain foods are truly putrid to us.\n\nI should just say, certain\nthings are putrid to us, and we should not consume them, right?\n\nAt the far end of the spectrum, it's hard-wired for us to avoid those, because they can be dangerous for us.\n\nThey can make us very, very sick.\n\nBut it's also true, that if we continue to eat foods that are progressively sweeter and sweeter and highly palatable, it shifts our dopamine system, because it activates our dopamine system to make us believe that those foods are the only foods that can\ntrigger this reward system, and make us feel good,\nand that they taste good.", "but then we come to Crave these things because we know what they do to our body we like what they do to our body and that doesn't just make us take them like they're medicine we actually somehow change our very perception of how that flavor is we actually come to savor that flavor we previously found disgusting and it's because our sensation of what is what is whether something's good or bad depends on an internal State and so it's an interesting idea you know perhaps if these Ultra processed foods that have so many different ingredients and such an unnatural combination perhaps this process of learning about the nutrient content of different foods and flavors becomes impaired because it's just the brain is not used the brain's used to saying you know this is a piece of chicken and this is primarily protein and so I can gauge you know from this Flav I can connect this flavor to an amino acid content but something that's so diverse it might be harder to do and isn't it the case that the neurons in the gut and the hormones that are produced by the gut as we digest food and that the neurons in the brain that can control appetite and feeding have to be tuned to macronutrient content because those are the U primary colors of of nutrients and nutrients are uh the way in which we can persist um on a day-to-day basis right I mean I'm not trying to sound more sophisticated where simpler terms would suffice what basically saying is that the neurons in our brains that control these behaviors both eating and cessation of of eating an ingredient or an entire meal can't be tuned to a particular food product or to chicken or to an egg or to a steak uh or to lentils um but rather to amino acid content essential amino acid content in particular essential fatty acids and in the case of carbohydrate whatever is going to replace whatever glycogen we might have depleted right", "Sugar or sweet tastes, I should\nsay, to be more specific, have an incredibly potent ability to activate dopamine release within the mesolimbic reward pathway.\n\nThis has been shown over\nand over and over again in animal models and in humans.\n\nThis is especially true, I should mention, through the ingestion of sweet liquids.\n\nNow this becomes a very\nimportant point to us a little later on when we\ntalk about the proliferation of sodas and sweet drinks,\nand dare I even say, non-sugar or diet sodas, we're going to get into\nthat a little bit later.\n\nThey are perhaps one of\nthe most third rail topics in nutrition.\n\nBut when we ingest something sweet, the perception of that sweet taste increases dopamine in the\nmesolimbic reward pathways, which then are conveyed to\npathways for motor behavior, and in general, place us\ninto modes of focused action toward getting more of whatever was sweet.\n\nAgain, for those of you\nthat are very disciplined, you can probably eat that\none piece of chocolate and be just fine.", "but it's still shunning shaming um self attack and and anxiety depression Etc in boys the neural circuits that we're talking about are are related to sex and violence those evolved over hundreds of thousands not millions of years and those are heightened so we're s capturing the the extremes of these neural circuit functions I'm looking at this through the lens of a neurobiologist this is great and this is where it seems we're running into trouble because the the iceberg below all of that the portion of the iceberg below those those peaks of behavior and interactions like none of that's happening there isn't the um it's all happening faster it's more potent and the consequences are are more severe that's right that's right I think there's a good analogy here to junk food where I've heard junk food or the H you know a cheeseburger described as a super stimulus um and you know ice cream is a super duper stimulus you know it's got fat it's got sugar right and a and a cheeseburger with a milkshake and the milkshake has candy in it yeah ice cream and then you get a toy and they're playing music I mean that's a dopamine bath that's right", "So a really good example that\nI think is an exciting one is as it relates to sugar.\n\nSo we all know that sweet\nthings generally tastes good.\n\nI'm not particularly a\nfan of very sweet things.\n\nYou know, I'd much rather have cheese or pizza or hamburger or steak.\n\nI like savory fatty foods, but I do like sweet foods.\n\nAnd most people find sweet\nfoods to be attractive.\n\nThey want them, they might or they might not be able\nto regulate their behavior around them, but they want them.\n\nAnd what's really interesting\nis that for hundreds of years people have thought that that's because of the way that sweet foods taste.\n\nSo that makes sense, right?\n\nYou eat something that tastes sweet.\n\nYou want more of it.\n\nWell, it turns out that it's much more interesting than that.\n\nWhen you eat something sweet within your stomach,\nyou have cells, neurons, that sense the presence of sugary foods independent of their taste\nand signal to the brain.\n\nSo those sensors, those\nneurons send information up the vagus to your brain goes through a series of stations.\n\nAnd then you release dopamine.\n\nThis molecule that makes you want more of whatever it is that you just ingested.", "- But you have to think\nof it not as humans, remember we inherited the\ncircuits of our ancestors and they through evolutionary\nfrom their ancestors.\n\nAnd we haven't had that many years to have fundamentally\nchanged in many of these hardwired circuits.\n\nSo forget as humans, let's look at animals in the wild.\n\nWhich is easier now to\ncomprehend the logic.\n\nYou know, why should this take a long time of continued reinforcement given that I can taste it in a second?\n\nYou want to make sure that this\nsource of sugar, for example, in the wild is the best.\n\nIs the richest.\n\nIt's the one where I get the most energy for the least amount of extraction, the least amount of work.\n\nI want to identify rich sources of sugar.\n\nAnd if the system simply\nresponds immediately to the first sugar that gets to your gut, you're going to form the association with those sources of food, which are not the ones that\nyou should be eating from. -\n\nDon't fall in love with the\nfirst person you encounter.\n\n- Oh my goodness, exactly.\n\nAnd so evolutionarily by\nhaving the taste system, giving you the immediate recognition, but then by forcing this gut brain axis to reinforce it only when sustained repeated exposure has informed the brain.\n\nThis is the one you don't want\nto form the association before.\n\nAnd so when we remove it from the context of we just go to the supermarket, we're not hunting there in\nthe wild where I need to form.\n\nAnd so what's is that\nhighly processed foods are hijacking, co-opting\nthese circuits in a way that it would've never happened in nature.\n\nAnd then we not only find\nthese things appetitive and palatable, but in addition, we are continuously reinforcing, the wanting in a way that,\noh my God, this is so great.\n\nWhat do I feel like eating?\n\nLet me have more of this.", "and then I'm sure you're anticipating what's coming somebody can just hear the buzzer or the Bell can simply ring and that person will experience an increase in insulin so what I'm describing is a conditioned insulin response a stimulus such as a bell or a buzzer that on its own should have zero effect on insulin release has been paired with a food that genuinely increases insulin within the bloodstream and then even if the food isn't present the stimulus the buzzer the Bell Etc can evoke the insulin response now this is an important example to understand because it's a common one that we've presumably all experienced and that exists within the wiring of our brain right now but it's different than the smell evoking the insulin response because delicious food which evokes an insulin response having a particular odor that makes sense in the context of food but here we're talking about something completely unrelated to the food not the odor not the taste not the appearance just something that happened to be in the environment in which you ate the food leading to an increase in insulin and it just screams placebo effect", "Well, there are events that a\nsingle event is so traumatic that it activates the circuits in a way that it's a one trial learning.\n\nAnd the taste system is literally at the top of that food chain.\n\nAnd there is a phenomenon known as conditioned taste aversion.\n\nYou can pair an attractive\nstimuli with a really bad one, and you can make an animal begin to vehemently dislike for example, sugar.\n\nAnd that's because you've\nconditioned the animals to now be averse to these\notherwise nice taste because it's been associated with malaise.\n\nAnd when you do that, now you could begin to ask\nwhy has change in the signal as it travels from the tongue to the brain in a normal animal versus an animal where you\nhave now transformed sweet from being attractive to being immersive.\n\nAnd this is the way now\nyou begin to explore how the brain changes,\nthe nature, the quality, the meaning of a stimuli\nas a function of its state.", "but that's one idea very interesting I'd love to talk about dopamine sure we hear so much about dopamine being involved in pleasure I like to think I've had at least a small level of impact act in convincing people that it's also involved in perhaps mostly involved in things like motivation different forms of learning and lots of other things too folks dopamine does lots of things it's even expressed in the eye and controls adaptation to light so does lots of things but it certainly is believed that dopamine is involved in our either craving for food or pleasure from food what's the real story on dopamine as it relates to food and eating Behavior you had a beautiful paper publish in nature entitled and we'll put a link to this in the show note captions uh dopamine subsystems that track internal States um and I love this paper for a variety of reasons but if you could give us the high points of of your discoveries on dopamine as it relates to feeding I think um I know in fact that people would find it very Illuminating sure fantastic um so uh", "Now, even for people that\nare of healthy weight and who don't have metabolic syndromes, there may be an additional reason to not want to ingest very sweet foods and highly refined sugars.\n\nAnd this has to do with\na new and emerging area of nutrition neuroscience.\n\nAnd I want to point out that\nthese are new data, right, so it's not a lock, the double blind placebo\ncontrolled studies in large populations\nhave not been finished.\n\nSo I want to make sure that that's clear, but I also want to make clear what some of the really exciting data, coming from Dana Small's lab at Yale, and from other laboratories are showing.\n\nAnd this has to do with what's called conditioned taste preference.\n\nUsing a kind of Pavlovian\nparadigm, what they do, is they have people, and these\nstudies were done in people, ingest maltodextrin, which\nincreases blood glucose, doesn't have much flavor, but even if it does have a\nlittle bit of subtle flavor, the maltodextrin is cloaked\nby some other flavor.\n\nAnd by cloaking it with that other flavor or pairing it with that other flavor, what they find is that over time, because the maltodextrin\nincreases blood glucose, and they're ingesting a particular flavor along with that maltodextrin, they can then remove the maltodextrin, and the flavor will induce\nan increase in insulin.\n\nThe increase in insulin of course, is the consequence of\nthe fact that anytime there's a rise in blood glucose, provided the person isn't diabetic, there's a parallel increase in insulin.", "So now, having talked\nabout some of the foods and micronutrients that are\nbeneficial to our immediate and long-term brain health, I'd like to shift gears somewhat, and talk about why it is that we like the foods that we like.\n\nWe've all heard before that we are hardwired to pursue sugar, and to like fatty foods, and that calorie-rich\nfoods are attractive to us for all sorts of reasons, you know, surviving famines,\nand things of that sort.\n\nAnd while that is true, the actual mechanisms that underlie food seeking and food preference are far more interesting than that.\n\nThere are basically three channels in our body and nervous system by which we decide what foods to pursue, how much to eat, and\nwhether or not we will find a particular food attractive, whether or not we will\nwant to consume more of it, whether or not we want to avoid it, or whether or not it's just sort of so-so, what I refer to as the\nyum, yuck, or meh analysis.\n\nAnd indeed, that's what\nour nervous system is doing with respect to food.\n\nIt's trying to figure out whether or not, yum, I want more of this, yuck, I want to avoid this, or meh, it's so-so.", "But after consuming foods\nthat perhaps are less sweet or even less savory, that are not what we would call highly, or I would say, nowadays,\nit's super palatable foods, we can adjust our sense literally of what we perceive as an\nattractive and rewarding food, and indeed, the dopamine system will reward those foods accordingly.\n\nI can't emphasize enough how much this learning\nof associated food reward is important for not just understanding why we like the foods that we eat, and how to eat more of foods\nthat are healthy for us, and enjoy them, but it also speaks to the fact\nthat our brain, as a whole, is a perceptual device\ntrying to make guesses or estimations about what certain foods are going to do for us.\n\nSo put simply, we don't just like sweet\nfoods because they taste good, we like them because they predict a certain kind of metabolic response.", 'So, Dr. Halpern pointed\nout that you actually have an accelerator that\nincreases your level of awareness and anxiety and sort of constricts your field of\nview and all your senses.\n\nAnytime you interact\nwith food and is driving a primitive reflex to ingest\nas much food as you can, as quickly as you can, and then move on from there, and presumably to do the same elsewhere.\n\nSo, that changed the way that\nI think about eating behavior and eating disorders.\n\nIn fact, we could think about\neating disorders like bulimia as an unmasking of that mechanism without the so-called top-down control, without the mechanisms that we\nuse to regulate our behavior.\n\nAnd indeed bulimia and\nbinge-eating disorder are closely associated with impulsivity and with impulsive\nbehaviors of other kinds, something that we also will discuss more.', "but when I walk into a convenience store what I see as a pharmacy I really do I see alcohol caffeine energy drinks that have a number of different things in them designed to stimulate different neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin I see nicotine products I see high sugar high highly processed foods and keep in mind I was a teenager I mean I drank my Slurpees I had my butter fingers you know I wasn't you know Bart Simpson like in my lovely butter fingers but I liked them but but it was it was a smaller fraction of of what we ate and when we were at home those Foods were either not available or we weren't we certainly weren't allowed to eat them and um at libum you know um okay so what's clear to me is that the FDA makes decisions about what is safe what's not safe but for instance okay this last year there were several papers published in highquality journals showing that if people eat just High just Sweet and Savory Foods combined that neural in the brain rewire through process of neuroplasticity that drives increased appetite and changes the response to healthier food so that they don't taste as as satiating okay that's sort of a duh to a lot of people"]

Ground Truths: ["In the context of food and its effects on behavior, the term 'super stimulus' refers to food items that are designed to be excessively appealing, such as junk food, which can trigger heightened responses in the brain's reward system. For example, a cheeseburger or ice cream can be considered super stimuli because they contain high levels of fat and sugar, leading to a strong dopamine response, akin to a 'dopamine bath.'"]

Answer: 

I apologize, but I don't have any information about the smoking rate among American High School students in 1997 from the Huberman Lab podcast or YouTube videos. The information available primarily focuses on more recent e-cigarette and vaping use among teens, with some historical data starting from 2017. 

For context, the data discussed shows that e-cigarette use among teens saw a dramatic increase between 2017 and 2019, with rates reaching 27-29% for past 30-day use among high school students. Since then, there have been fluctuations in usage rates, with some sources reporting declines to around 10% in recent years, though there's debate about the accuracy of these lower figures.

It's important to note that this data refers to e-cigarette and vaping use, not traditional cigarette smoking, and it doesn't provide any information about smoking rates in the late 1990s. To answer the specific question about 1997 smoking rates, we would need additional historical data that is not present in the provided information.

we think was part of why we also saw further drops around 2021 but people were concerned about their lung health and teens as well and that's great the latest data show that their rates are under 10% the National Data I actually don't think it's true and the reason I don't think it's true is I'm in the schools doing curriculum presentations all the time where I teach and educate teachers to use our tobacco and cannabis prevention curriculums and we've never been busier than we are right now with schools just crying for help we have an another group of teenagers using ecigarettes nicotine or

1. Depression and anxiety: There's been a notable increase in depression rates among girls since around 2012, coinciding with the widespread adoption of smartphones. Girls appear to be more affected than boys, with some studies showing that using social media for 3 hours or more daily doubles the risk of anxiety or depression symptoms.

2. Time spent on devices: Young people, including girls, are now spending an average of about 5 hours a day just on social media. This significant time investment can have various effects on mental health and overall well-being.

3. Body image concerns: Nearly half of adolescents report that using social media has negatively impacted their body image. While this was initially thought to primarily affect girls, it's now increasingly observed in boys as well.

4. Sleep disruption: About a third of adolescents report staying up until midnight or later on weeknights using their devices, with much of this time spent on social media. This reduction in sleep can significantly impact mental health, especially during crucial developmental stages.

5. Exposure to harmful content and interactions: Girls face risks of exposure to inappropriate content and interactions online. For instance, six out of ten adolescent girls report being approached by strangers on social media in ways that made them uncomfortable.

6. Social and physical development: There are concerns about how smartphone use might be altering social and physical development. The reduction in face-to-face interactions and outdoor activities in favor of digital communication and screen time could have long-term effects on social skills and physical health.

7. Self-esteem and authenticity: Constant comparison to others online and the pressure to maintain a certain image or "brand" on social media can erode self-esteem and make it challenging for girls to develop an authentic sense of self.

It's important to note that while these impacts are concerning, smartphones and social media can also offer some benefits, such as providing support and connection for some individuals. However, the overall picture suggests that careful consideration and potentially intervention are needed to mitigate the negative impacts on girls' mental health.

but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "oh if you're being contacted by strange men around the world who want to have sex with you like that's not good for 11 12 year old girls so it's all these different potential harms and then imagine all these different potential effects S one of which is depression and another is anxiety another is self harm but there's doing worse in school there's becoming more shallow there's uh conflicts with your so there's a whole bunch and then we want to look at the causal connections and what I'm trying to draw out is suppose you we suppose we could quantify the degree to which sheer time just spending five hours a day does that make you more anxious automatically well maybe a little um but that's probably not the main effect so there's a gigantic multicausal network of effects now um I have good numbers for how much the how much teenss are using these devices and these platforms today um Pew in particular did has done a great job of of tracking changes in this since the ear since the 2000s what we know today from both Pew and Gallup is that young people in America are now spending about five hours a day just on social media just social media", "yep there's additional blue light exposure there's just so much to it exactly so if we pull all that together for the time being and put it in a basket of smart phone use and maybe we'll we'll pull out each of those variables one by one as we go forward what are the numbers in 2012 in terms of how much time girls maybe you can give us an age range are spending with the smartphone was it they got the smartphone and immediately we're spending six to eight hours a day on the thing or has it been gradual so let's let's start with the time the time variable sure okay so first the way you put it is actually very helpful um what I want listeners to imagine let's say like imagine on the left left side of a slide I haven't made this slide I'm formulating in my head imagine on the left side of the slide a whole bunch of harmful changes if you're getting less sleep that's bad if you're having blue light at night that's bad if you're not going out in nature that's bad if you are sedentary if you so so imagine about you know 15 different things", "so yes there is some evidence that overall phones and smartphones have increased risk behavior but it's more the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "so I I point to that it's that 5-year period 2010 to 2015 which I've called the Great rewiring of childhood because it affects everything everything about what children and teenagers are doing I can recall in 2010 I was actually in New York City visiting friends I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting yeah nowadays I think of it less as addicting but almost um like an an OCD of sorts and here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD but the interesting thing about OCD is that the compulsions the behaviors don't serve to reduce the obsessions rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them and in many ways I feel like smartphone use and social media use in particular is a OCD of sorts it's not just habit it's not just an addiction it's an obsessive compulsive Loop so it's already a struggle to pay attention and you know ancient Traditions have have taught techniques to improve your focus your attention we're easily distracted and um you know so I don't work on my phone very much because I I hate to type on the phone and and I'm always at a computer but even for me sitting at my computer as soon as the thinking gets hard as soon as if I'm writing if I'm doing something that requires concentration some little part of my brain says I wonder what the weather's going to be and I go check the weather or you know oh did I get any email I go check my I might check my email you know probably 40 50 times a day and I know that's terrible so the question is is it a compulsion where I feel pulled I have to check it or something bad will happen no it's more like imagine trying to do your work imagine trying to be a kid in school and you have on your desk in front of you you have your television set your record player a walkie talk to talk to your friends a guitar a painting set all array in front of you and your teacher is telling you about you know geometry what are you going to do probably one of these things and so I think the smartphone where a flip phone it's it's a tool you pull it out if you want to talk to someone then you put it away but the smartphone there's no reason to ever put it away talk to us about the scary statistics there's just no way around this yeah", "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media"]

Ground Truths: ["The impacts of smartphone use on girls' mental health that should be considered include the time spent on the phone, the specific content being viewed, the social dynamics associated with phone use versus in-person interactions, the disruption in sleep, and additional blue light exposure. These factors contribute to the overall diminishment in mental health among young girls."]

Answer: 

According to the information from Dr. Jonathan Haidt, there have been efforts to protect parents who allow their children to play outdoors independently. An organization called "Let Grow" has been working to address this issue. They have successfully advocated for laws in eight states that specifically state that allowing a child to play outside cannot be used as evidence of child neglect.

This legislation is important because current laws in many areas are ambiguous regarding children's independent outdoor activities. Without these protective laws, parents can face serious consequences for allowing their children to play outside unsupervised. For example, if an 8-year-old child is seen alone at a store, concerned neighbors might call the police. This can lead to involvement from Child Protective Services, potentially resulting in custody battles and family supervision.

The new laws passed in these eight states aim to prevent such situations and protect parents who want to encourage independent play for their children. These laws recognize the importance of outdoor play and aim to reduce the pressure on parents to constantly supervise their children.

It's worth noting that this legal protection is part of a broader effort to restore play-based childhood experiences, which have become less common in recent decades due to various societal changes and increased fears about child safety.

of that this is insane um so we so law could help to put to to stop incentivizing helicopter parenting to provide uh uh more spaces that are safe for kids to play in not car zones um so the book has the exas generation the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "whatever but um but kids need to be out playing with each other especially Outdoors we evolved in savanas we evolved in different parts of the world we're attracted to Nature um so that's the way it it always was now uh especially if we in the 1950s and 60s America just been through a World War and the greatest way to make people trust each other the greatest way to boost social capital is a foreign attack and of course Pearl Harbor did more for American Co coherence than anything else in history in modern history 911 did that too but only for a little while and then we we lost it um so for a a lot of reasons people trusted their neighbors kids were out playing you know my parents grew up in the depression in New York City the kids were all out playing stickball on the street or in a parking lot in the 1970s there is a real crime wave um crime goes through the roof actually and it goes through the 80s that goes all the way to the early 90s even still you were kicked out of the house to go play um even in New York City all kids went out to play that's just the way it was but we begin to lose trust in each other for a lot of reasons Robert putam wrote about this in Bowling alone the the the the loss of Social Capital many reasons for that the changing media environment air conditioning and television people are not hanging out on their porch in the summertime to get away from the Heat they Clos the door and they put on the AC and they watch TV family sizes are shrinking there are not that many kids around so for a lot of reasons by the the 90s is the key decade where act two of the tragedy happens and that's the loss of the play-based childhood", "I love what your mom did getting you guys outside um my parents did the same thing too like we I was very blessed to have two parents who didn't come you know they didn't have a lot of resources growing up they didn't come to this country with a lot of resources but the one of the greatest gifts they G gave us is that they loved us uncondition Al the other great gift that they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out", "you know I'm sure other people are buying these car seats you should be fine I would have been very disturbed by that right no parent wants to feel that information is being hidden from them about the health impact of products on their kids that's what we have right now so this is a place where I think while yes uh and we we'll we should we'll talk about some steps parents can take because I want to get to practical steps of people who are here as parents or people have kids in their lives can take but we we we need policy makers to step up and step into the void here and to fill the Gap because this is too much again to just ask parents to manage entirely on their own and this isn't again about telling parents what to do and restricting them this is about giving them the support they need so they have confidence uh when they see uh you know a technology out there a device out there a product out there for kids that they know it's been tested that it's been studied and that it's actually safe for their children my understanding is that in uh countries like China there are limit as to how many hours kids can be on screens period", "so in America and Britain we freaked out about child abduction and child sexual abuse um some of the scandals were real the Boy Scouts the Catholic Church there were cases where trusted organizations were covering up abuse and I recall the abduction thing the carton y thing right and there was a show I think my name is Brian you know about the kid who was abducted and then all he remembered I think it's a true story was that his name was Brian he would just remind himself every night about his real name you know I think they found him eventually in Berkeley mhm not calling out Berkeley I lived in Berkeley for a long time but um seemed to be the discovery of of Abu of abducted kid excuse me in Berkeley uh there are a few other cases there I don't know what that's about um in any of I grew up thinking that you could get kidnapped right yeah which yeah which is so it's I mean it's the most terrifying possibility for any parent um but when I was doing the research for the codling the American mind I found according to FBI statistics there's only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings a year in our whole country because if a child like who would take a child like it's a really difficult crime and you're going to you know who would steal a child from a store you know parents are afraid if your kid goes to the next D on the grocery store going to be how are you going to take a kicking and screaming kid out of a store um it's and yet sorry to interrupt but the show America's Most Wanted I believe was hosted by a guy whose kid was abducted and eventually found dead exactly Adam that's right right so so there was this propagation of this fear like that one of the deepest fears of any parent I can to imagine is is is that that's right but the point is that these crimes are extraordinarily rare it's almost always the non-custodial parent who takes a kid it's a family member because there's a fight within the family um so we fear the wrong things we're terrified of kidnapping um but locking our kids up overprotecting them has spiked the suicide rate so much that the death toll is vastly higher from the extra suicides than it would be if we could completely wipe out kidnapping which again doesn't", "most Instagram no so it the the huge time suck is the videos so it's actually Tik Tok and YouTube are counted in this analysis they're counted as social media YouTube is marginally social media it's more of an general information Source but the point is especially the short videos the short videos are really really addictive because the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the house every day to go play my mom would say get out of the house I now realize she wanted space yeah"]

Answer: 

The impact of post-2010 smartphone technology on gender social engagement and workplace efficiency is a complex topic, and the available information doesn't provide a comprehensive answer. However, we can draw some insights from the provided information.

Smartphone adoption and usage patterns changed significantly between 2010 and 2015. By 2015, the majority of Americans, particularly teenagers, had smartphones with front-facing cameras and high-speed internet access. This technological shift allowed for much more extensive phone use, with some people spending 10-15 hours a day on their devices.

The introduction of platforms like Instagram, which was designed specifically for smartphones, changed how people, especially young girls, engaged socially. This shift in social interaction patterns likely affected both genders, but there's a particular emphasis on its impact on girls in the available information.

Regarding workplace efficiency, the information doesn't directly address this aspect. However, we can infer that the constant connectivity and potential for distraction provided by smartphones might have implications for workplace productivity. For instance, there's mention of how smartphones can make it difficult to concentrate on tasks, with users frequently checking their devices even when trying to focus on work.

It's important to note that the information doesn't provide specific comparisons between genders in terms of social engagement changes or workplace efficiency impacts. Additionally, while the adoption of smartphones has clearly changed social dynamics, the exact nature and extent of these changes, particularly in a gender-specific context, are not fully detailed in the provided information.

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of how post-2010 smartphone technology has affected gender-specific social engagement and workplace efficiency, further research focusing specifically on these aspects would be necessary.

the great majority of Americans certainly teens have a smartphone with a front-facing camera the girls are mostly on Instagram which was the first social media platform that you had to be on a smartphone for everything else was web based um they have High-Speed Internet unlimited texting and now it's possible to spend 10 15 hours a day on your phone you nobody could do that with a flip

I'm a longtime fan of your work I've read the cuddling of the American mind it's an incredibly important book The anxious generation incredibly important book I'll just start off with an easy question which is how are we doing as a species ah how are we doing as a species well as a species as one of my friends said you know we're going to be pretty hard to kill off we'll be like cockroaches and you know we're pretty inventive in that way uh but as a civilization I think we might well be at a point of there are Peaks and valys and there are some Cycles in history and we uh may be at one of those turning points and uh it's going to be pretty unclear what happens over the next five or 10 years um it's a very interesting time to be a social scientist I'll just leave it at that I suppose we can't point to any one factor but we wouldn't be sitting here today you wouldn't have written in the anxious generation and it wouldn't be having the incredible impact that it's having were it not for the fact that smartphones have dramatically profoundly changed the way that we interact as a species in fact a colleague of mine at Harvard Jeff lickman who's world famous for neuroplasticity said a few years back you know this is probably the first time in human history that humans have written with their thumbs implying that the brain representation of the thumbs is probably very different in all of us um than it was uh prior to that because the brain is an Adaptive map of of our experience in many ways that's a somewhat innocuous example of the changes that have occurred the use of the digits uh the thumbs uh to write but there's so much more going on now as a consequence of smartphone", "so I I point to that it's that 5-year period 2010 to 2015 which I've called the Great rewiring of childhood because it affects everything everything about what children and teenagers are doing I can recall in 2010 I was actually in New York City visiting friends I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting yeah nowadays I think of it less as addicting but almost um like an an OCD of sorts and here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD but the interesting thing about OCD is that the compulsions the behaviors don't serve to reduce the obsessions rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them and in many ways I feel like smartphone use and social media use in particular is a OCD of sorts it's not just habit it's not just an addiction it's an obsessive compulsive Loop so it's already a struggle to pay attention and you know ancient Traditions have have taught techniques to improve your focus your attention we're easily distracted and um you know so I don't work on my phone very much because I I hate to type on the phone and and I'm always at a computer but even for me sitting at my computer as soon as the thinking gets hard as soon as if I'm writing if I'm doing something that requires concentration some little part of my brain says I wonder what the weather's going to be and I go check the weather or you know oh did I get any email I go check my I might check my email you know probably 40 50 times a day and I know that's terrible so the question is is it a compulsion where I feel pulled I have to check it or something bad will happen no it's more like imagine trying to do your work imagine trying to be a kid in school and you have on your desk in front of you you have your television set your record player a walkie talk to talk to your friends a guitar a painting set all array in front of you and your teacher is telling you about you know geometry what are you going to do probably one of these things and so I think the smartphone where a flip phone it's it's a tool you pull it out if you want to talk to someone then you put it away but the smartphone there's no reason to ever put it away talk to us about the scary statistics there's just no way around this yeah", "so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "so yes there is some evidence that overall phones and smartphones have increased risk behavior but it's more the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "Etc um some of the protocols as we'll call them are incredibly easy to Implement others take some discipline so I'd like to talk about both sets today but the first question I have is um do you own a smartphone I do have a smartphone yeah well here's the thing I don't use social media so it turns out smartphones aren't that interesting if you don't have any social media apps on it yeah what's that like so there's there's nothing if you have nothing that is engineered to try to grab your attention the smartphone actually goes back to 2007 Steve Jobs keynote address smartphone which is the is a really nice phone and your music you can listen to things on it and uh the phone interface is really good and look there's a Maps app and you can like look at maps on it like it's actually a useful piece of technology that you're happy to have but uh you don't use it that much what about text messaging do you text message and if so do you get into conversations by text or is it more of a a plan and meet type tool uh I try right so so I try I do use text messaging I mean this is how like my wife gets in touch with uh but I'm notorious somewhat among my friends of my the ability to capture my attention with text messages really hit or miss because I'll go hours without looking at my phone"]

Answer: 

Since the early '90s, there have been notable changes in self-harm rates for girls, with a particularly significant shift occurring around 2012. 

From the 1990s through 2010-2011, self-harm rates for girls were relatively stable. During this period, the percentage of girls suffering from anxiety, depression, or engaging in self-harm remained fairly constant, with some measures even showing slight improvements.

However, a dramatic change occurred around 2012. At this point, there was a sharp uptick in self-harm rates for girls, described as a "hockey stick" pattern on graphs. This sudden increase was not subtle; it was as if "somebody turned on a light switch in 2012." The change was so pronounced that it's been likened to an "elbow" in the data.

This trend wasn't limited to a single country. Similar patterns were observed across the developed world, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Scandinavian countries. While the exact year might vary slightly between countries, the sharp increase for girls was consistent.

The magnitude of this change is significant. Depending on the specific measure, increases ranged from 50% to 150%, with many indicators nearly doubling. This is particularly true for younger girls.

It's important to note that this trend is not just based on self-reported data. There have been increases in more objective measures as well, such as hospital admissions for self-harm and psychiatric emergency department visits.

While boys have also experienced increases in depression and anxiety, their trend line is generally smoother and began slightly earlier, around 2009-2010, gradually increasing thereafter.

These changes coincide with the widespread adoption of smartphones and social media, which is considered a potential causal factor for this alarming trend in girls' mental health.

talk about what that means uh going forward but where are we at now and when did we start to see the trend toward diminish mental health in particular in girls yeah so feel free to hit us with the with the scary truth okay sure so let's imagine so in the US we have really good statistics based on annual or biannual surveys there's three or four big ones that allow us to see what's happened since the 70s and so what I'd like listeners to imagine is imagine a bunch of lines maybe a line for boys maybe a line a line for boys line for girls showing the percentage that suffer from anxiety depression or that have self harm those three really go together and imagine these lines they move around a little bit but they're actually pretty stable from the 1990s all the way through 2010 even 2011 there's no sign of a problem on some measures they're getting actually a little bit better because stable and low stable well low you know if it's if they're around say 12 15 % of girls qualify

American data um internationally you see very similar things it's not necessarily 2012 in other countries but the girls graphs are very sharp the boys are also up on depression anxiety they're also way up depending on the measure it's usually everything is in the ballpark of 50 to 150% almost all the numbers are in that range um we're not talking 10 or 20% increases here for most things we're talking close to a doubling especially for the younger girls the boys curves interestingly are smoother that is the boys are more depressed and anxious it's but it's not 2012 it it actually often begins begins more like 2009 2010 and then it just keeps going up gradually so that that's a real clue um which we'll come back when we talk about the the boy story um it a lot of people say oh you know it's just self-report um you know just gen Z they're really they're really um positive about mental health and they're willing to talk about it's a good thing", "but there's this whole category

it propagates yeah none of this two or three chess moves down the down the road um so it's very clapback sometimes in or in that case building up Joo who doesn't need any more building up but people do it anyway so things of that sort so interested in the in these um in the Nuance here because um you're telling me that girls are killing themselves more they're depressed their increase in suicide is larger boys have a much higher suicide rate so boy many more boys die from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or a bridge whereas girls tend to use pills or cutting their wrists and they and the great majority of girl suicide attempts don't lead to death yeah so are most of the issues with girls and online use social media it's sort of um uh it's despair it's at home anxious sad about self self- critiquing this kind of thing I mean you're telling me there's a a huge and I believe you that there's a tremendous increase I mean he said hockey stick like function um when we're looking at essentially capturing the tip of the p pyramid in terms of like extreme social interaction so take let me I'm not being very very clear here we have these neural circuits that evolved for social interactions that are more heightened in girls they're getting much

hopefully we change the culture again uh but it it's an interesting thought I mean as soon as you said that I was thinking yeah I mean they're certainly not out as much as they used to be in terms of and we're talking about this at the beginning we're not seeing them out in Parks as much we're not seeing them playing pickup sports games as much as we used to but I don't think that's because of ecigarette use I think that's because of social media and just the whole change and honestly parents being afraid of letting their kids out for some predatory behavior and in other ways um and you mean if kids are let out of the house they're more at risk to predatory behavior but of course they're also at risk when but just by use of the phone because the phone connects everywhere absolutely the phone connects everywhere and that's something we try to teach teens as well but I think that that's been something that parents are worried about you know I have to you almost the pendulum almost swung too much of now I have to keep my kid in because I don't want to let them out of the house and I don't want to let them alone driving and alone at the park and things like that but I think that we've reduced you were talking earlier about autonomy we've reduced teens just autonomy and they they have to get into a little bit of trouble they have to jwalk they have to do I mean I'm not encouraging but you know but but we there's some natural amount of getting together and hanging out and being crazy at the park and playing and playing games and things like that and I think that has stopped or or slowed down a lot uh I I see it with with some people in my own Community I don't see as much just hanging out in the front yard and shooting the breeze and instead they're they're inside and they're on their phones and and stuff like that so could that be part of why we're seeing more ecigarette use possibly I just don't haven't I haven't seen the studies on it yeah perhaps that's a good segue into risky behaviors when I was a kid I mean the dumb stuff that we did um meaning dumb because it was dangerous to ourselves I mean I am not suggesting people do this kids please don't do this just don't but just the dumb stuff of you know jumping off roofs or between roofs um I'm not going to give any other uh any anecdotes just uh it's amazing that we all survived um and and some didn't but that was largely the consequence of drugs alcohol mental health issues of kids I knew um but car accidents um actually I grew up in the uh in the mother's Against Drunk Driving era and there was a there real discouragement around drunk driving I was fortunate that at least in high school most of my friends didn't drink or didn't drink much um but you still heard about fatalities kids happen um even one is is too many obviously um what's going on now in terms of risk-taking behavior um driving fast driving drunk um doing what used to be just described as dumb stuff um that unfortunately sometimes is is fatal or you know results in paralysis people jumping off bridges into water without testing the water depth you know we've all heard the stories and sadly um they true stories of people becoming paralyzed that kind of thing dumb stuff dangerous stuff teens do more of it um is it still true that males are doing more of that physical danger stuff than than um than females or is that not true that's what we used to hear but then of course there's been this big push importantly really to um balance out the amount of research on on both sexes"]

Ground Truths: ["Since the early '90s, self-harm rates for girls have shown stability until around 2012, when there was a significant increase, described as a sharp rise like a hockey stick. This indicates a dramatic change in the mental health landscape for girls, with the rates going up sharply after 2012."]

Answer: 

Humor and team dynamics play a crucial role in risk management and trust-building in high-stakes situations. In environments where the stakes are high and stress levels can be intense, humor serves as a powerful tool for team cohesion, stress relief, and maintaining a positive mindset.

In high-risk professions like FBI hostage negotiation, humor is often used as a bonding mechanism within teams. Chris Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator, emphasizes the importance of good-natured humor and playful interactions among team members. This type of humor reinforces emotional connections, friendships, and mutual understanding within the group. It creates an environment where team members feel comfortable with each other, which is essential for effective communication and collaboration in high-pressure situations.

Similarly, in military special operations, humor plays a significant role in team dynamics. Jocko Willink, a former Navy SEAL, describes how teams use humor, even in the form of mockery, to maintain composure and prevent panic. For instance, team members are cautious about sounding panicked on the radio during missions, not only because it could cause others to panic but also because it would lead to teasing from teammates later. This use of humor serves as a mechanism for maintaining calm and focus in extremely high-risk situations.

The concept of "dynamic subordination" in special operations teams also relates to how humor and team dynamics affect risk management. In these teams, leadership roles can shift based on the situation and required skills. This flexibility is supported by a culture where team members can be "relentlessly hard on each other" through humor, which helps maintain high standards and readiness for high-risk scenarios.

Humor also contributes to building trust within teams. By creating an environment where team members can joke with each other and take "good-natured ribbing," it fosters a sense of camaraderie and mutual understanding. This trust is crucial in high-stakes situations where team members need to rely on each other implicitly.

Moreover, a playful state of mind can actually improve performance in high-stakes situations. The ability to maintain a level of playfulness, even in serious contexts, allows for more creative problem-solving and novel approaches to challenges. This can be particularly valuable in risk management, where innovative thinking may be necessary to navigate complex and dangerous scenarios.

However, it's important to note that the use of humor in high-stakes situations requires a delicate balance. While it can be a powerful tool for team building and stress relief, it must be used appropriately and not at the expense of the seriousness of the task at hand. The key is to foster an environment where team members feel safe and supported, allowing for both focus on the mission and the ability to use humor as a coping and bonding mechanism.

In conclusion, humor and positive team dynamics significantly contribute to effective risk management and trust-building in high-stakes situations. They help create a resilient, adaptable, and cohesive team capable of performing under extreme pressure while maintaining the necessary focus and creativity to manage risks effectively.

subordination Dynamic sub Dynamic subordination kind of like a flock of birds but is how it was described to me but you know I always thought in in the you know tier one uh Special Operations

was a he was a COO commanding officer in one of the East Coast Seal Team squadrons to one Seal Seal Team squadrons he said the reason they're so effective in those those groups is because they um Embrace Dynamic subordination where people take over as different skill sets are required and and they are relentlessly hard on each other this is something they like relentlessly hard at the level of humor but also I mean because it's so high cons high risk and high consequence they're just extremely hard on one another but it's all about this Dynamic subordination that sure they're leaders by virtue of who's appointed leader um and certain amount of authority but there's this constant Dynamic subordination and it exists in every group of males I've ever been a part of and it's wonderful and very reassuring to me because it means that you both get to potentially step up but you also get to rest when you and trust somebody else's skills I don't know how it operates with with girls I've only been um you know born with a Y chromosome this is all I know but um I imagine it exists there too in different but in different ways um so if online everything is fear-based where one is fearing

people are clearly engaging in, you know, playful, jabbing or sarcasm or things of that sort.\n\nSo each of you will have a\ndifferent experience of this, but the point is that play\nserves many

a cost at the level of what we might call group creativity right a lot of our best ideas come not from our minds but from the space between us from dialogue uh or from group conversation and it turns out that in stacked rank zero some environments people are less willing to share knowledge and perspective because doing so amounts to helping your enemy succeed which is the same as helping yourself fail so to the extent that creativity requires a sort of collaborative mindset then cynicism is uh is is preventative of that and there's actually some terrific work um uh by by Anita wooly and colleagues uh that looks at group intelligence collective intelligence this is the idea that of course people have levels of intelligence that can be measured in various ways and have various forms of intelligence as well but groups when they get together have a type of intelligence and especially creative problem-solving intelligence that goes above and beyond the sum of their parts that can't be explained and actually in some cases is almost orthogonal to the intelligence of the individuals in that group right controlling for the intelligence of individuals there's a group factor that still matters and so Anita willly and others have looked at well what predicts that type of collective intelligence and a couple of factors matter one is people uh people's ability to understand each other's emotions so interpersonal sensitivity but another is their willingness to in essence pass the mic to share the conversation and to collaborate and so again uh succeeding thriving optimizing and being creative both at the individual and at the group level require environments where we feel free and where we feel safe and where we feel that contributing to somebody else can also contribute to ourselves it's so interesting to think about all of this in the context of neuroplasticity"]

Ground Truths: ["Humor and team dynamics affect risk management and trust in high-stakes situations by fostering an environment where team members are relentlessly hard on each other, which is done in a humorous way. This dynamic subordination allows individuals to step up when needed and trust others' skills, creating a reassuring atmosphere. In high-risk scenarios, this camaraderie helps mitigate fear and encourages participation, as team members feel safe enough to communicate openly and address mistakes without severe repercussions."]

Answer: 

The purpose of implementing phone-free schools is multifaceted and aims to address several key issues related to learning, focus, and student well-being.

Firstly, phone-free schools are designed to improve learning and focus. By removing smartphones from the classroom, students are better able to concentrate on their lessons and engage with the material being taught. As one example mentioned, a teacher struggled with students constantly using their phones during class, with one student admitting to watching TikTok throughout the entire lesson. Removing phones allows students to dedicate their attention to learning rather than being distracted by social media or other apps.

Secondly, phone-free schools aim to reduce distractions. Smartphones are described as "the greatest distraction devices ever invented," and their presence in classrooms can significantly hinder the learning process. By implementing phone-free policies, schools can create an environment more conducive to learning and brain development.

Another important purpose is to promote real-world interactions and experiences. Phone-free schools encourage students to engage with their peers and teachers face-to-face, fostering better social skills and relationships. This approach also supports the development of problem-solving abilities and conflict resolution skills in real-world settings, rather than through virtual interactions.

Additionally, implementing phone-free schools addresses mental health concerns associated with excessive smartphone and social media use. The context mentions links between smartphone use and increased rates of depression, anxiety, and even suicide among young people. By limiting access to these devices during school hours, educators hope to mitigate some of these negative effects on students' mental health.

It's worth noting that implementing phone-free schools can be challenging. Some schools have tried policies where students keep phones in their pockets, but this often leads to constant conflicts as students struggle to resist the urge to check their devices. More effective approaches include using phone lockers or special pouches to secure devices during school hours.

While the benefits of phone-free schools are significant, it's important to recognize that this is part of a broader approach to reimagining childhood and adolescence in the digital age. Experts suggest that these policies should be combined with other initiatives, such as delaying smartphone ownership and social media use until later teenage years, and promoting more independence and free play in the real world.

Retrieved Contexts: ["so because if if it's true that puberty is a sensitive period for many higher level uh uh aspects of our Humanity such as identity relationship skills all that stuff then you should be extra careful when your kids are 9 to 15 years old you should be extra careful about what's going into their eyes and ears and instead that's when we give up all control you know when our kids are little they pay attention to us we read to them we have a lot of control about what our kids consume when they're toddlers And when they're very young but as they reach middle school and high school they're moving away they're seeking out other stuff and that's exactly what we say here here's your own device you want to go down a rabbit hole of eating disorder stuff you want to go down a rabbit hole of of you know of you know Tourette Syndrome um you're going to copy people who have these symptoms so the last thing we should be doing is exposing our children in this sensitive period to socializing information from random weirdos on the internet who were selected by an algorithm for the extremity of their behavior and the degree to which that extremity earned them likes which makes them extra prestigious um so yeah I laws that raise the age to 16 or 18 I think that's what we need um this is just not appropriate for minors even if there's some good stuff on it I think it's vastly outweighed by the bad so that's and that's the second Norm no smart no social media till 16 uh the third Norm is phone free schools and again you know if we expect kids to learn and learning is brain change if you're learning something you're developing a skill something about your brain has changed uh how about instead of learning math or reading or litter or anything else how about if you just do more phone stuff you just spend more time in school on Tik Tok there was just an article in the Washington in the Wall Street Journal about a teacher who fought against the phones and finally gave up and quit and one of the students in his classes quoted um that she used to she'd come into class and she would just go on Tik Tok and that's what she would do all class long is just watch Tik Tok in her desk um you know and like no you should be learning not doing more Tik Tok in school so it's just insane that we let kids take the greatest distraction devices ever invented into the classroom with them I would argue that they are learning but what they're learning are these rapidly reinforced dopamine Loops that lead to diminished amounts of dopamine not just in short periods of time but very quickly and that inhibit other forms of learning yeah that's right and the ability to pay attention right to to a teacher which is not as stimulating as what you're seeing on Tik Tok there's tons of learning it's but it's learning of all the wrong things that's right that's right", "so that's the third Norm is uh no uh is phonefree schools you have to lock up the phone in the morning either a lock in a phone lock or Yonder pouch um if the policy is you keep in your pocket that's not a policy that's just a recipe for constant conflict with the kids because they can't help it they have to text if anyone's texting they have to be texting and the fourth Norm is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real world because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing we have to do is restore a really fun adventurous childhood like you know what you were saying you know you go out on your bicycle you're hanging out with your friends friends sometimes something happens and boy you have memories I mean exciting things happen scary things happen you have memories and you know I worry about like what you know what boys today you know I have a group of Buddy my group of friends that I you know we we still talk about things that happened you know things that amazing things that happened when we were in college or after college and I wonder what boys young boys today are going to say you know you remember fortnite game 27363 where you were trapped in that Elevator Shaft and I had to shoot you out no I don't remember that one you know like uh the the virtual Adventures are just not going to cut it our kids need Adventure they need Independence and Adventure uh where they work out the conflicts themselves", "so I I point to that it's that 5-year period 2010 to 2015 which I've called the Great rewiring of childhood because it affects everything everything about what children and teenagers are doing I can recall in 2010 I was actually in New York City visiting friends I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting yeah nowadays I think of it less as addicting but almost um like an an OCD of sorts and here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD but the interesting thing about OCD is that the compulsions the behaviors don't serve to reduce the obsessions rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them and in many ways I feel like smartphone use and social media use in particular is a OCD of sorts it's not just habit it's not just an addiction it's an obsessive compulsive Loop so it's already a struggle to pay attention and you know ancient Traditions have have taught techniques to improve your focus your attention we're easily distracted and um you know so I don't work on my phone very much because I I hate to type on the phone and and I'm always at a computer but even for me sitting at my computer as soon as the thinking gets hard as soon as if I'm writing if I'm doing something that requires concentration some little part of my brain says I wonder what the weather's going to be and I go check the weather or you know oh did I get any email I go check my I might check my email you know probably 40 50 times a day and I know that's terrible so the question is is it a compulsion where I feel pulled I have to check it or something bad will happen no it's more like imagine trying to do your work imagine trying to be a kid in school and you have on your desk in front of you you have your television set your record player a walkie talk to talk to your friends a guitar a painting set all array in front of you and your teacher is telling you about you know geometry what are you going to do probably one of these things and so I think the smartphone where a flip phone it's it's a tool you pull it out if you want to talk to someone then you put it away but the smartphone there's no reason to ever put it away talk to us about the scary statistics there's just no way around this yeah", "yeah I uh have family relatives with um who are in their teens and it's interesting to see them interact um where they're on their phones a lot of the time but I've also noticed that there's a cohort of kids that are really trying to put their phones away and just spend time together and that was actually directly stated to me that oh yeah we hang out and we make it a point not to be on our phones when we hang out and then but then of course they'll text or be on the iPad with one another in the evening when they're apart so they're sort of never apart right um but I do think there seems to be at least a sub movement of um kids and teens that are trying to do more face Toof face interaction with devices at least put aside I answer a really good point I've talked to some teens who say that they all they get together and they will deliberately put the phones face down in the middle no phones and have dinner have a conversation so I I think you're right I definitely think that that that has been a movement and I really appreciate that and I think that's fantastic I've also seen circumstances where two teens are trying to help each other with homework and they're texting each other which is fine but I've often said why don't you just pick up the phone and call the person and in five minutes you can figure out the math assignment instead of 20 30 minutes of back and forth", "I I was delighted um it seems to me that if there was an understanding that the biology and psychology and sociology points to the fact that there is a critical period maybe not even a sensitive period but a critical period in which excessive smartphone use of a particular type is actually leading to more suicides depression anxiety and less learning and um adaptive behavior in life it seems to me that it should be a almost like a law it should be implemented at the level certainly at the national level what what sorts of barriers do you think exist to that um you know obviously I'm enthusiastic in joining your effort and and um I know many people listening will be as well to try and Implement these four things but what do you think it would really take to get people to take their children's brains and lives seriously because children can't be left to their own self-care to that degree it's just unfair right I mean it's like telling a kid in a candy shop like Hey listen you know figure it out you know there's nutritious food down the stre like it's unfair right it's like a puppy trying to trying to do the you know Westminster Championship it's like it's not going to happen um you know but this is serious stuff I mean we're talking about the future not just of the United States but of the entire species so um what about laws what about legislature how does that work I don't know anything about that sure well first so you know let's let's note you know I could be wrong about this um it might be that the phones aren't doing this now I think the evidence is pretty good that it is but let's suppose there's a 70% chance that I'm right let's Suppose there was only a 30% chance I was right the the consequences are so severe we should be taking action now what action to take I was over in the UK for the book about three weeks ago and in the UK you know and the rest of Europe the first thought of everyone is Ban it ban it ban it government law ban", "I will say that a\ngraduate student in my lab who was immensely productive and focused, had the habit of coming in each day, she would take her phone, I\ndon't know if she turned it on, or off or not, and she would\njust place it in a door, excuse me, in a drawer and would then go start doing experiments.\n\nWe do experiments all day at 10 courses, engage in discussions\navidly with the rest of us, and then would take her phone out at the end of the day and leave.\n\nAnd I don't think that\nbehavior was not correlated with her immense productivity.\n\nI think the ability to untether\nourselves from the phone is going to be the way in which many of us are either going to succeed or\nfail in our various pursuits.\n\nI'm somebody who engages on with the phone on a regular basis throughout\nthe day for various reasons, but I do try and have\nlarge swaths of the day in which it's either on airplane mode or it's completely\nphysically separated from me.\n\nWhen I'm in large swaths,\nI might do every other hour with the phone on airplane mode or even a two or three hour\nabout where I just am simply not engaged with the phone at all.", "so yes there is some evidence that overall phones and smartphones have increased risk behavior but it's more the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "but but for one of the other negative effects right so we have the positive effects you talked about which is consolidation of learning and acceleration of learning we had the one negative effect which was the pavlovian connection to distraction the other I've written about before is Solitude deprivation right so so I'm using a different definition of solitude than the colloquial one most people think of it as a physical thing I'm I'm just isolated but there's a there's a cognitive psychological definition of solitude which means absence of stimuli created by other human Minds right so I'm not taking in information that's coming directly from another human mind uh having no period with this Solitude so having no period in your day where your free from stimuli creative from other Minds is Solitude deprivation and it's a real issue and partially it's a real issue because when we're processing input from another human brain it's all hands- on Deck right I mean we're very social beings a huge portion of our brain is dedicated to this right um so it's a very cognitively expensive activity when I'm trying to understand another human's what they're saying I'm simulating their mental state I'm trying to understand like where do they fall in this sort of social hierarchy and one of my arguments was um when you spend your entire day in that state it's exhausting and anxiety producing and like until we had smartphones and ubiquitous wireless internet the idea that you could banish all Solitude from your day is laughable it's just impossible right so of course we had a lot of portions of our day where our brain was not like ramped up in gear four like the sort of social processing mode but smartphones makes it possible that you can be in that mode all day long and so like one of the things I hypothesize is some of the anxiety Rises that goes with the age of smartphones is brain exhaustion right so that's like that's another negative effect of the const we have two negative effects now for the constant stimuli and one positive effect for the absence of the constant stimula so I think we're making a case here for not always being on your device", "Okay, so we talked about cannabis.\n\nWe talked about alcohol.\n\nLet's talk about cell phones.\n\nFirst of all, I use a cell phone.\n\nI use it very often.\n\nAnd I do not think they are evil devices.\n\nI think that they require some discipline in order to make sure that it does not become a\nnegative force in one's life.\n\nSo I personally restrict\nthe number of hours that I'm on the phone and in\nparticular on social media.\n\nI only answer email at\nparticular times of day.\n\nBut what about the cell phone itself?\n\nYou know, when I was a junior professor.\n\nI was a pre-tenure early professor.\n\nI taught this class on neural circuits in health and disease.\n\nAnd one of the students asked me, you know are cell phones\nsafe for the brain?\n\nAnd you know, all the data point to the fact that they were.\n\nOr at least there were no data showing that it wasn't.\n\nI still don't have the\nanswer on that, frankly.\n\nI don't see a lot of studies about it.", "I mean it's crazy what happens so eight states have now said no no more of that this is insane um so we so law could help to put to to stop incentivizing helicopter parenting to provide uh uh more spaces that are safe for kids to play in not car zones um so the book has the exas generation the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "it it's it's cropping up in different ways I'm meeting more and more some of these are organized efforts but I'm also meeting more uh families uh where the parents and kids together have decided that they're going to delay using social media and you know till past middle school or in some cases even later or where they're deciding that they're going to draw boundaries around social media use or they're going to replace their smartphone with a dumb phone that allows them to do things like text and make phone calls and use maps and and all that stuff but doesn't necessarily have social media apps on it now this is still a small minority and and we're dealing with a bit of a network effect here right because if you're the only one who's not on social media uh in your middle school class then you might feel left out which is why it's so important for parents to and and kids actually do this together", "Now in the digital realm,\nI already mentioned a few of the things that we\ncan do as practical tools to limit interruptions.\n\nOne is use the program Freedom, the other would be to\nsimply turn off the wifi.\n\nIf you do need to be\nonline and navigating, you're doing research of any kind, that's not going to be possible.\n\nTurning off one's phone, I've at times, put my phone on airplane\nmode, if that didn't work, I've locked it in a safe, I've done that, I'd left in the car outside.\n\nIt all depends on one's\nlevels of self-discipline, which as you probably know,\nfrom your own experience, tends to kind of wax and wane.\n\nSometimes we are better at avoiding these\ndistractions than others.\n\nSo if you find yourself in\na place where it's very hard to reduce those distractions, you may need you to go\nto more elaborate lanes.", "I think you'd have much better outcomes if that's part of what you learned at the University was how to take the thing in your head and really put it to work you know really extract out of it his capabilities or even high school or even Elementary School level I agree you U you have kids yeah um do they have smartphones no yeah how do they feel about that well I mean they're not they're not old enough yet that it's a it's a real problem um but they're they're not going to be having happy with me probably soon hate me now love me later as my mother used to say basically because I you know I'm I'm convinced having spent some time thinking about this writing about this doing some journalism on this talking to a lot of the experts that like I think where we're going to end up where all the the arrows from the the relevant social psych research which um I've been following This research since you know 2017 this is 2017 is roughly when you see the first warning signs going up that we need to worry about the potential mental health impact of these tools especially social media and smartphones on young people and I you can track this right I have a talk I I actually gave it my kids school not happy about this where I tracked how this research evolved and you know like any literatures it's contentious at first", "oh these terrible devices um rather it's about a vision of childhood which is actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the reason why I got this far is because it's a set of collective action traps everyone every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone so the four recommendations I have are four ways of breaking out on the Trap but the first two are really about delaying and getting past this period of plasticity and you really help me see why it's so urgent to delay until late puberty at least so here are the four Norms that I think can break us out of this trap Norm number one uh no smartphone before high school you can give your kid a flip phone flip the Millennials had flip phones they came out fine no access or no smartphone of their own your own you can't have your own and that would even go for an iPad if you give your kid an iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it

Answer: 

The relationship between myopia and screen time in children is complex and has been the subject of evolving research. Initially, studies suggested a direct link between near activities, such as reading or computer use, and the development of myopia in children. This led to the assumption that increased screen time could contribute to the rising rates of nearsightedness.

However, recent research has shifted focus to a broader environmental factor: indoor vs. outdoor time. While screen time often correlates with increased indoor time, it appears that the lack of outdoor exposure may be more critical in myopia development than screen use itself.

Studies have shown that children who spend more time outdoors, particularly in natural sunlight, have a lower risk of developing myopia. This protective effect seems to be related to the full spectrum light exposure received outdoors, rather than simply the distance at which objects are viewed.

For instance, a study published in the journal Ophthalmology in 2018 found that children who spent about 11 hours per week (or roughly 2 hours per day) outdoors had a significantly reduced probability of developing nearsightedness. This outdoor time was beneficial even if the children were reading or engaging in other near-vision activities while outside.

The mechanism behind this protective effect is still being researched, but it's believed that the intensity and spectrum of natural light play a crucial role in proper eye development. Indoor lighting typically doesn't provide the same benefits as natural sunlight.

It's important to note that while screen time itself may not be the primary culprit, it often contributes to increased indoor time and near-vision activities. Therefore, balancing screen time with outdoor activities is recommended for children's eye health.

To mitigate the risk of myopia, experts suggest:
1. Encouraging children to spend at least 2 hours a day outdoors in natural light
2. Balancing near-vision activities with distance viewing
3. Taking regular breaks from screen time to look at distant objects
4. If possible, moving some screen-based or reading activities outdoors

In conclusion, while there is a correlation between increased screen time and myopia in children, the relationship appears to be more closely linked to reduced outdoor time rather than screen use itself. Promoting outdoor activities and ensuring exposure to natural light may be more effective in preventing myopia than strictly limiting screen time.

starting to get thoughtful on the science of myopia control how do we how do we provide the right environments now what's interesting is that for decades the Assumption some of the data really led us to the path of thinking like gosh the more you spend near activities and these are Mouse model experiments like you described but also well-designed human cohort studies you know figuring out like asking you know kids and families like how long is your kid reading or in front of the computer how myopic are they how nearsighted are they versus how much time is your kid in front of the computer doing near work how myopic or nearsighted are they and these well-designed cohort studies did Point tour words this concept that if you do too much near work as a kid that you're more likely to develop nearsightedness as you get through those those sort of you know uh pre-teen and even into the teen years which is when most of that myopia progression or eyeball elongation is actually happening to cause nearsightedness it's only been in the last few years that some really exciting Studies have actually pointed in a slightly different direction and that's that maybe it's not all not to say it's not about near activity but maybe it's not all about near activity maybe it's actually a little more about the kind of light we're getting into our eyes and I think you've talked about this before", "So what I just\ndescribed actually explains pretty well why kids\nwho look at computer screens, or books up close\noften need glasses.\n\nWhen I was growing up, they\ncalled this nerd

I've generally focused on foot Sports throughout my entire life as opposed to you know precise hand-eye coordination I'm better at throwing darts and things with one eye closed than I ever would be with both eyes maybe that's true for most people question I have is is it true that even just a few hours of misalignment of information to the two eyes early in development can permanently rewire the brain unless there are some corrective measures such as patching up one eye and the example I gave is just one but for instance if um uh you know someone injures you know gives a scratch on their cornea and they close they patch the eye and the person happens to be 10 years old is it important to then patch the other healthy eye after the the um you know the scratched eye is feeling better in other words how critical is it to ensure the balance of information coming into the two eyes even on the order of hours or days yeah your story is uh it has some features of uh you know totally usual how we think about misaligned eyes leading to amblyopia where one eye is weaker patching the strong eye so the weak eye can recover but not necessarily fully regaining depth perception and so that part of it is you know quite stereotypical the part of your story that's atypical is that for most kids um an hour to let alone minutes an hour to even an hour to a day if you were I don't know if you were a young kid and you just really were training up on throwing darts and you were just keeping one eye closed to throw the darts you know really practicing for an hour a day it'd be very unusual for that to trigger this kind of either strabismus misalignment of the eyes let alone amblyopia and the strabismus is what's giving you the double vision because they're misaligned let alone the amblyopia of one eye turning out weaker if I had to guess of course not having you know done your exam before that fateful day in the swimming pool if I had to guess I would guess that you may have had some intermittent business and your brain was already getting kind of hit and and you neither you nor your parents may have even noticed it it could be happening you know at other times a day or you're not kind of really paying attention it doesn't kind of stand out in the way that that that day that you got out of the swimming pool you really noticed it and it may not have been that strong it may have been quite intermittent but if you had had some years of intermittent isotropia or turning in of the eyes or exotropia turning out of the eyes that just happened here and there but was accumulating sort of uh damage or failure to connect over years leading up to that day in the swimming pool and that day just tipped you over the edge and you've got double vision you really noticed it that led to an eye exam and an eye care provider and they said wait a second this size stronger this size weaker you've got a little amblyopia we're going to start patching your strong eyes so you can get your weak eye back so for 99.9 percent of the kids who like you know yeah they get a little corneal scratch or they're patching one eye closed or or uh you know anything that's sort of a rare event like that nothing to worry about parents don't have to worry kids can be kids they can play they can do that kind of thing and uh and not have to worry and and it's unfortunate that we can't tell in advance which kid's been having the intermittent amblyopia because we don't do a standard eye exam on every five-year-old who's not complaining of anything but but yeah so that's a that's an unusual case in yours and if I had to guess I I would bet that you were having some sort of subclinical untracked Uncharted unnoticed maybe strabismus leading up to that point okay great thank you you can send me a bill at the end um along those lines I'm 47 years old so I was part of the generation that grew up with some computers in the classroom but not a lot nowadays kids from a very young age are looking at iPads and phones and screens and things very close up and there is a wealth of experimental animal data showing that if you limit Vision to just close range that the eyeball lengthens and therefore the visual image Falls in front of and not directly onto the neural retina the essentially the light sensing portion of the of the eye and those animals become myopic or nearsighted what can we say about the environmental conditions in which kids are seeing from the time they're born through let's say adolescents and their teen years in terms of how their visual system wires up and are there any recommendations that are coming from the scientific literature clinical studies clinical trials excuse me or otherwise that indicate what a healthy visual environment consists of", "So I just want to briefly\ndescribe this study, because it's a very important one, and I don't think it's\ndiscussed often enough.\n\nThere are many studies exploring this, but one of the ones I liked the most, looked at 693 students, and a subset of them were encouraged to spend 11 hours a week outdoors.\n\nOkay, so most kids are in\nschool five days a week or so, so they're spending 11\nhours a week outdoors.\n\nThey are sometimes reading outdoors.\n\nThey're not always just playing outdoors, they might be reading books, et cetera.\n\nThey used eight different schools.\n\nAnd the reason they did the study, I probably should have mentioned, is that myopia, nearsightedness,\nis a global epidemic.\n\nAt least, that's how it was\nreferred to in the study.\n\nI don't know who decides\nwhat's an epidemic or not.\n\nI think there are thresholds for that.\n\nThis paper published in the\njournal Ophthalmology in 2018 described the fact that being\noutdoors for two hours a day could significantly reduce the probability that these children would\ndevelop nearsightedness.\n\nAnd it turns out based on other studies, that adults who spend\ntwo hours a day outside, that would be reading\noutside, talking outside.", "and it's really important when they've now studied and asked the kids instead of just how much near and how much far are you doing how much time are you spending indoors in indoor lighting which doesn't have full spectrum light in a typical indoor environment versus how much time are you spending Outdoors playing in the yard you could be reading outside but what are you just what kind of time are you spending outside and and of course when you're outside in sunlight even it's in direct sunlight you're getting a different spectrum of kind of Full Spectrum Lighting from the sun and it looks like it's pretty clear now actually that it has maybe more to do with outdoor lighting time than just near work and so I think that you know we we've we've actually already seen the first couple randomized controlled trials where they're having kids intentionally spending time Outdoors versus sort of Standard Life which you know is going to be often much more indoor time and uh and seeing some effects you follow those kids over a couple of years and the kids who spend time Outdoors are are progressing in their nearsightedness less like they're they're nearsighted prescription is not getting as strong as the kid kids who are spending more time indoors and there's some pretty good biology that's getting worked out going back to animal models more about about how that might be working in the retina in this inside the eye but it's pretty compelling uh concept and and so you know as a parent uh you you may want to be you may want to be telling your kid like okay yeah I want you to read that book or you know if your kids plan on the phone or something like that or the iPad or something like that they're allowed that time okay you can have that time", "In fact, it should\ncome as no surprise that the incidence of\nmyopia, of nearsightedness, is increasing dramatically\naround the world but is increasing\nparticularly fast in children and in young adults\nand even in adults who are viewing things at very\nclose range, so 2 and 1/2 feet or less.\n\nNow, I am not saying\nthat viewing things at 2 and 1/2 feet or less is bad\nfor your eyes, that is simply not the case.\n\nHowever, if you want your\nvision to be maintained or even improve, it's going\nto be very important for you to view\nthings at a distance as well for ideally\nseveral hours per day.\n\nNow, I realize some people just\nsimply won't accomplish this.\n\nIn fact, I'd like everyone\nto just take a moment and do a rough\nestimation in your head of how much time during\nyour daytime activities you are viewing things at,\nsay, 2 and 1/2 feet or 3 feet or less, so\nsmartphone, computer screen, paper, books, et cetera,\nversus viewing things that are 4 feet\naway, 8 feet away, so maybe conversation across the\ntable with another human being.\n\nRemember those?\n\nSome of us are\ndoing that more now that we seem to be emerging\nfrom this whole pandemic phase.\n\nHowever, many people are\nstill mostly just viewing things within very close range.", "In any case, the social media and staring at a small visual aperture is changing our brains.\n\nHere's one way I know in\nwhich it's changing our brains and then I'll tell you how to fix it.\n\nIf you stare or look at\nsomething within two feet of you for a certain number of hours each day, your eyeball actually gets longer.\n\nAnd the visual image then is focused in front of your neural retina,\nnot onto your neural retina, and you are becoming myopic; nearsighted.\n\nAnd if you look at things\nin the distance enough, guess what?\n\nYour eyeball changes shape\nand your lens will focus appropriately the image onto your retina.\n\nIt takes some work.\n\nKids that look at things\nup close too much, and adults that look at\nthings up close too much become nearsighted.\n\nAnd there's a beautiful\nset of clinical trials now where mainly in kids, if kids get outside for two hours a day, getting a lot of this UVB and blue light that we're told is so terrible for us, but they get it from sunlight, they actually can reverse myopia, or reduce the incidence of\nmyopia, maybe even glaucoma.\n\nAlthough that's a big maybe.", "Meanwhile, if the first\nbehavioral protocol for enhancing and\nmaintaining eye health is to make sure that you're\nspending at least some time balancing out the near vision\nand far vision during the day, it also stands to\nreason that you want to get outside for\nat least two hours a day, which I know sounds like a lot,\nin order to prevent myopia, if you're a young person,\nand offset the progression of and maybe even\nreverse some myopia, we don't know yet\nbased on the data, but there's some\nindication that's possible, by getting\noutside two hours a day.\n\nAnd the cool thing is, because\nmany people, including myself, have a lot of work to do and\nwe need to be on our phones quite a lot, or we choose to\nbe on our phones quite a lot, this effect of getting sunlight\noutdoors during the daytime for two hours or\nmore does not seem to require that you stay\noff your phone or tablet, or that you're looking at\nthings far in the distance the entire time.\n\nWhat this means\nis, if you can get outside onto a patio or a deck\nor an outdoor table if you can, if weather and\nconditions permit, and do some of your phone time\nand

Answer: 

The significance of having no piano lessons on Fridays in the proposed free play schedule is multifaceted. This approach, referred to as "free free play Friday," is designed to provide children with unstructured time for exploration and social interaction. By eliminating structured activities like piano lessons on Fridays, children are given the opportunity to engage in self-directed play and experiences.

This concept aligns with the idea that unstructured time is crucial for children's development and mental health. In today's highly structured environment where children's lives are often filled with numerous activities and academic pressures, dedicating a day to free play allows for creativity, reflection, and natural social interactions.

The absence of piano lessons on Fridays is not about depriving children of musical education, but rather about creating a balance. It's part of a broader approach to give children more autonomy and trust in their ability to navigate their own experiences. This can lead to improved problem-solving skills, social development, and overall well-being.

Moreover, this approach recognizes the importance of diverse experiences in child development. While structured activities like piano lessons are valuable, unstructured play time is equally important for the nervous system to develop as it was meant to. It allows for a variety of interactions and experiences that contribute to a child's overall growth and mental health.

It's worth noting that this concept of "free play Friday" is not about completely eliminating structured activities, but rather about creating a balanced approach to child development. It acknowledges that while consistent practice in activities like music is important, it's also crucial to have time for unstructured play and exploration.

Answer: 

Foundational nutritional needs play a crucial role in overall well-being, impacting both physical and mental health. These needs form the bedrock of our health and performance, serving as the basis upon which other aspects of well-being are built.

Firstly, foundational nutrition involves obtaining sufficient macronutrients - proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. These are essential for energy storage, cellular repair, and the production of neurotransmitters that affect our mood and cognitive function. For instance, amino acids derived from protein sources are precursors to important neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, which significantly influence our mental health.

Micronutrients, including vitamins and minerals, are equally important. They support various cellular functions and metabolic processes in our body. Obtaining these from high-quality, unprocessed or minimally processed food sources is crucial for optimal health. The quality of our food sources matters, as industrial agriculture practices have led to a decrease in the micronutrient content of some foods.

Additionally, foundational nutrition includes adequate intake of fiber, probiotics, and prebiotics. These components support gut health, which is increasingly recognized as a key factor in overall well-being. A healthy gut microbiome, supported by proper nutrition, can influence both physical and mental health.

It's important to note that foundational nutritional needs go beyond just meeting caloric requirements. The quality and variety of food sources are crucial. Consuming a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and other minimally processed foods provides a broad spectrum of nutrients that our bodies need for optimal functioning.

Foundational nutrition also plays a role in managing stress and supporting the body's ability to adapt to various stressors. Some nutrients and compounds, often referred to as adaptogens, can help buffer against stress and support overall resilience.

In conclusion, foundational nutritional needs are fundamental to our overall well-being. They support physical health, mental function, stress management, and provide the building blocks for all cellular processes in our body. Meeting these needs through a balanced, varied diet of high-quality foods forms the basis for optimal health and performance.

Retrieved Contexts: ['To make a long story short.\n\nThere are many things that\nwe all can and should do to support our overall\nmental and physical health.\n\nAnd these are the foundational elements of quality nutrition.\n\nWhat that means to you?', "okay so this is a key Point even though many supplements are not simply food supplements because they are not designed to compensate for anything that you could otherwise get from food that is not to say that you can live on supplements you know I suppose you could live on whey protein and fish oil capsules and vitamin capsules or tablets for a short while but before long you'd either suffer from boredom to the extent that you'd want to go back to food or some other deficiency would show up I think it's the rare individual that tries to survive entirely on food supplements and things of that sort most everybody and I would hope everybody is paying attention to their nutrition so I would Place behavioral tools do's and do Nots as layer one the deepest layer the Bedrock of all mental health physical health and performance on top of that I would Place nutrition and of course that's going to mean different things to different people with the understanding that there's a huge array of different food choices and nutritional programs nutrition is fundamentally important for macronutrients for storage of energy in the form of glycogen fats and phosphocratine stores and so forth but also for obtaining basic nutrients vitamins minerals and micronutrients", "so we we've done this um you know uh to ourselves but the food industry has really promulgated it because we farmed out nutrition policy and information to the food in so they actually use this for their purposes it's one of the problems in this field as we all know quality nutrition influences of course our physical health but also our mental health and our cognitive functioning our memory our ability to learn new things and to focus and we know that one of the most important features of highquality nutrition is making sure that we get enough vitamins and minerals from highquality unprocessed or minimally processed sources as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber to support basically basally all the cellular functions in our body including the gut microbiome", "but to the extent that you can control it within the confines of life and its demands keep your nighttime environment dim or dark because that independently of any sunlight and other bright light that you're viewing during the daytime and afternoon is going to positively improve your mood and mental health now moving on to the other pillars and these I'm going to move through a bit more quickly than I have the previous two because we've done entire series on these or I should say serieses serieses is that how you pronounce it someone put the plural of serieses in the show in the comments on YouTube the third pillar is movement and when I say movement I mean exercise as you all know we should all strive to get anywhere from 180 to 220 minutes of Zone 2 cardio per week that's movement that allows you to hold a conversation but where you to do it more intensely or even a bit more intensely you wouldn't be able to hold that conversation in addition we should do some V2 Max work we should get our heart rate very high at least once a week doing some sort of movement that's safe for you so that could be running or cycling or swimming or Pilates whatever it is for you getting your heart rate way way up is also important and to do that at least once a week but daily movement either cardiovascular training or resistance training and it's very very clear that we need both maybe not on the same days in fact I split them to separate days resistance training done for anywhere from six to 10 sets per muscle group either close to or to failure this could be with weights it could be with bands it could be with machines all of that was covered in detail in the podcast series that I did with Dr Andy Galpin an exercise physiologist who's expert in all those areas I also did an episode on a foundational Fitness protocol that has been distilled into a very simple three-page PDF that you can get for completely zero cost by going to hu lab.com and just put foundational Fitness protocol PDF and you'll be taken to that toolkit so all of the details of a weekly exercise routine that involves daily movement but also certainly in my case includes at least one full day of rest per week because many people do indeed need one maybe even two full days of rest per week so that highlights the third pillar movement but we know that cardiovascular training and resistance training aren't just great for our body they also improve mood and mental health that's so very clear from the research literature so we can't Overlook those in a conversation about mood and mental health now the fourth pillar is nutrition and nutrition is a big topic it's a very barbed wire topic if you get involved in this stuff online you know you you've got your people who believe that you know carnivore is better than vegan you have the people who believe vegan is better than carnivore most people are omnivores you have your seed oil debates and on and on and on we're not going to touch any of that now indeed if you want to learn more about nutrition and what works and what doesn't work for sake of aesthetic changes weight loss muscle gain Etc I would refer you to the guest episode that we did with Dr Lane Norton you can find that again at huberman lab.com where we do a deep dive on all the variations in different nutritional protocols but suffice to say that regardless of whether or not you're vegan omnivore carnivore or keto or whatever everybody needs to consume sufficient amounts but not excess amounts of quality calories per day now you may do that by intermittent fasting you may do that by a more traditional meal scheduling but everybody's going to need to do that because your body and brain and indeed the parts of your body and brain that translate to mood and mental health require macronutrients proteins fats and carbohydrates as well as micronutrients so the key takeaway with nutrition is to make it quality nutrition within the bounds of whatever sort of nutritional program that you're following and that means getting most of your food sources from either nonprocessed or minimally processed foods so these would be foods that you're going to need to prepare or foods that would perish um over time these are not the sorts of foods that live in boxes and cans and other uh packages that would allow them to live on the shelves forever and ever okay and as I say that I know many people are shouting well what about rice you know rice can live on the shelf for a long time and yes okay I consider rice a minimally processed food because of course it can live on the shelf for a long period of time and here I'm just going to back out of the whole conversation about nutrition at this point because as you can probably tell it's a deep series of rabbit holes that we can fall into and really get distracted the point is make sure you're getting enough food don't overeat we know energy toxicity is a problem for not just body composition but for mental health so you want to get enough calories but not too few calories and you want to make sure that you're getting them from quality sources", "and then we have crappy soil because our industrial agriculture system which means the the food in some cases has 70% less of key micronutrients in it so that 70 metric tons what's actually useful for our body becomes so much smaller so what we want to do is basically expand and the value of that substrate we're putting in the body and that means real food unprocessed from good soil meet the needs of the cells naturally don't be hungry maintain a healthy weight um and you know something I talk about is that we could I mean we could talk about nutrition the biochemistry of nutrition all day but in my review of sort of the biology and the biochemistry like there's five main things I think we can strive for in our food that can really help meet the needs of our cells and and when it really comes there are obviously more things our body needs", "but you don't know what to do with those data inside tracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional behavioral maybe even supplementation based interventions you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors hormones lipids and other things that impact your immediate and long-term Health to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you if you'd like to try inside tracker you can visit inside tracker.com huberman and get 20 off any of inside tracker's plans that's inside tracker.com huberman to get 20 off the other category foundational supplements are those adaptogens that we mentioned earlier adaptogens again being a very poorly defined category but these are typically micronutrients herbs sometimes they go into the mushroom category again these are non psychedelic mushrooms that provide either some buffering to the stress system by reducing cortisol typically or that are thought to or known to based on research studies to enhance things like blood flow to the brain or to enhance some aspect of cognitive function by way of enhancing neurotransmitter function this category of so-called adaptogens is an important one we'll get back to this a little bit later the reason I mention it now is that it is indeed hard to get the so-called adaptogens in sufficient concentrations from food-based sources I have to assume that most people aren't out there collecting chaga mushroom or the ashwagandha herbs and then combining them with their salads or their foods and so that's why this adaptogen category fits into foundational now this opens up the category of foundational supplements that are broad spectrum that is that include vitamins and minerals that have digestive enzymes that have adaptogens and that also have prebiotics and probiotics at the appropriate dosages this is one reason why I'm a big fan of supplements like athletic greens which is as many of you know a sponsor of this podcast and does really nicely cover all of these categories of foundational nutrition", "but it also includes things like canned soups and number of different other foods that have many many ingredients preservatives most people would do well to avoid those kinds of foods and focus most of their intake on things that are non-processed so these would be things like fruits and vegetables you'll notice that the non-processed foods will tend to have very short shelf life or require refrigeration in some cases such as meat eggs Etc or minimally processed foods such as you know rice and oatmeals and pastas beans and things of that sort beans oftentimes can be completely unprocessed as well of course these are two general categories unprocessed and minimally process that should make up about 80 or more of your food intake if your goal is health and obtaining adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals the so-called foundational supplements include of course vitamin and mineral supplements but has expanded over the last decade or more to also include supplements that have vitamins and minerals but also things like digestive enzymes and again here we have an example where indeed you can get digestive enzymes from foods for instance eating a bit of papaya or even a little bit of Pineapple can assist in the digestion of certain aspects of macronutrients because these are naturally occurring enzymes that help digest things like carbohydrates fats and proteins and there are other food-based sources of enzymes you're welcome to look those up online if you just put food based sources of enzymes and you'll find those but nowadays A lot of the foundational supplements will include papain or they will include different lipases or anytime you hear the word Ace by the way it means an enzyme an enzyme is designed to break down or to catalyze some sort of reaction in biology and nutrition in particular so you can find foundational supplements that include vitamins and minerals and digestive enzymes and nowadays more and more the quality foundational supplements are also including things like adaptogens and here the name adaptogens is sort of vague and it indeed has no specific operational definition this is something really important to understand about supplementation is that companies and indeed podcasts can talk about adaptogens without actually defining what an adaptogen is in an operational way when we say operational what we mean is a definition that everyone in a given Arena or space research for instance can agree on so that when we talk about the adaptogenic effects of a given compound we're all talking about the same things well foundational supplements nowadays include vitamins minerals digestive enzymes and the so-called adaptogens and the adaptogens broadly speaking are thought to improve the body and brain's ability ability to buffer against various stressors so these could be things like herbs like ashwagandha that are designed to reduce cortisol levels in that sense ashwagandha is an adaptogen but ashwagandha has other effects related to hormone augmentation in both the testosterone and estrogen and maybe even the thyroid", "Paul Conti: Well, I think we start with\nfactors that are really just baseline factors that have to be in place in\norder to achieve good things upon them.\n\nSo the basics of we have to be\neating well enough to feel okay and hopefully eating really well.\n\nWe have to stay hydrated, we have to\nget sleep, we have to move the body.\n\nThese are basics, but basics a lot\nof people are not attending to.\n\nSimilarly, we have to be in\na situation that isn't making fear and misery all the time.\n\nSo an example of an abusive relationship.\n\nA person has to navigate out\nof that before they can really start taking care of themselves\nin the way that builds goodness.\n\nSo we look for the basic factors\nthat we need to take care of in order to then look at the factors that\nbecome particular to each of us.\n\nAnd what we're really looking\nfor is self-understanding.\n\nHow much can we understand\nabout ourselves?\n\nBe knowledgeable about what's going\non inside of us, why it's going on.\n\nAlso, and very importantly, being\naware that we don't know everything that goes on inside of us, and being\ncurious about that and looking at how we're engaging with the world around us.", "but if we strive for these five things we will ultimately I think eat a really healthy diet and that is fiber Omega-3s adequate healthy protein a good amount of probiotics and high antioxidant sources and if we build our diet around knowing a few things in each of those categories that we really love and stock our kitchen with it and make our meals a mixing and matching of each of those components and we get a good amount of those we will give the body a lot of what it needs to have mitochondrial Health reduce chronic inflammation reduce oxy of stress it's interesting for me to take a step back from nutrition as it's typically presented and think about the brain the hypothalamic circuitry that drives hunger and satiety and things like that and to map that on to what I've heard and I I believe to be true based on my view of the literature which is that we are largely meaning these circuits in the brain make us largely amino acid foraging machines because we need those amino acids in order to carry out metabolic processes and reconstruct any tissues that need repair and and Recovery not just from exercise but just daily turnover um removal of waste Etc um so we're foraging for amino acids unconsciously we're foraging for micronutrients and of course we need macronutrients we need enough energy from proteins fats and carbohydrates or some either combination of the three I feel like I'm sort of in the dying category of omnivores right I'm neither you know I'm not meat-based and I'm not uh plant-based I'm omnivores I think most people are omnivores actually", "Pathways we'll talk about this a little bit later when we talk about supplements for hormone augmentation so foundational supplements has really expanded to include a lot of different categories of nutrients and micronutrients vitamins and minerals digestive enzymes designed to achieve a broad spectrum of effects again this is the one category of supplementation where I think it makes sense to explore multi-ingredient formulations and the other thing that's often included in these so-called foundational supplements are probiotics or prebiotics which are designed to augment and support the so-called gut microbiome the gut microbiome is the collection of trillions of little micro bacteria that exist in all of us they mainly exist in the mucous membrane-lined tissues of the body so that would be your nasal passages your mouth the vagina the urethra and the gut the whole way from your mouth all the way out the other end so not just your stomach trillions of bacteria live there trillions of microbacteria also live on your skin in fact every time you shake someone's hand you're exchanging microbacteria these micro bacteria often are healthy for us good for us", "and I say that because of course food is not just the substrate for the cellular repair and indeed production of tissues in your body but it's also the substrate for all the sorts of neurotransmitters right which are derived from amino acid precursors that are derived from food right all of that dopamine stuff and serotonin stuff is derived from amino acids that come from food sources so the link between nutrition and mental health should now be an obvious one as we all know quality nutrition influences of course our physical health but also our mental health and our cognitive functioning our memory our ability to learn new things and to focus and we know that one of the most important features of highquality nutrition is making sure that we get enough vitamins and minerals from high quality unprocessed or minimally processed sources as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber to support basically all the cellular functions in our body including the gut microbiome"]

Answer: 

Connecting people through technology offers several significant benefits. First and foremost, it enables the formation of meaningful connections and relationships across vast distances. These connections can contribute to increased happiness and even correlate with living longer, healthier lives due to the grounding effect of community.

Technology, particularly social media, allows individuals to communicate more easily, express themselves, and understand what's happening in others' lives. This increased ability to connect and empathize with others can be generally positive for social interactions and personal well-being.

Another benefit is the speed and efficiency of communication. Texting and other forms of digital communication have allowed for more rapid exchanges between people, significantly reducing the time it takes to share information or stay in touch compared to traditional methods like letter writing.

Interestingly, technology can also create social bonds through shared online experiences. When many people engage with the same content, such as viewing an Instagram post, it can lead to a synchronization of responses and even physiological reactions like heart rates, potentially fostering a sense of connection among users.

Technology has also brought increased convenience to our daily lives. Tasks like grocery shopping or mailing items can now be accomplished without leaving home, which can be particularly beneficial for those with limited mobility or time constraints.

Lastly, technology can provide new and innovative ways to interact, such as through virtual or augmented reality experiences. These advancements have the potential to create powerful and positive social interactions, although they may also introduce new challenges that society will need to navigate.

It's important to note that while these benefits exist, the impact of technology on social connections is nuanced. The design and use of technology play crucial roles in determining whether its effects are positive or negative. As we continue to integrate technology into our social lives, it's essential to be mindful of both its advantages and potential drawbacks to ensure we're using it in ways that truly enhance our connections with others.

Retrieved Contexts: ["but I think whether technology helps or hurts us is about how it's designed and ultimately about how it ends up being used and what we've seen with social media as well is that uh for many people it ended up leading to in-person connections being replaced with online connections um we came to somehow value and um almost seek out more and more followers and friends on social media feeling like somehow that made us more connected but the nature of dialogue also changed like as human beings we evolved over thousands of years to not just understand the words someone is saying but to hear the tone of their voice to see their facial expression like you and I are sitting across and and we're both processing like our body language right and I'm seeing you nod your head and I'm seeing your eyes focused like all of that matters to how we communicate um but also like you and I are less likely to say something hurtful right now to one another because we can see each other if I said something to hurtful to you like i' probably see the the pain or consternation on your face and that might give me pause right when you're communicating online with other people without any of that information or with any of the uh sort of barriers if you will that make you pause before you hurt someone it leads to a very different kind of communication uh one that can be quite hurtful at times", "MARK ZUCKERBERG: Sure.\n\nI mean, I think this is\na really important topic.\n\nThe research that we've\ndone suggests that it's not all good or all bad.\n\nI think how you're\nusing the technology has a big impact on\nwhether it is basically a positive experience for you.\n\nAnd even within technology,\neven within social media, there's not one type of\nthing that people do.\n\nI think, at its best, you're\nforming meaningful connections with other people.\n\nAnd there's a lot of research\nthat basically suggests that it's the\nrelationships that we have and the friendships that bring\nthe most happiness in our lives and, at some level,\nend up even correlating with living a longer\nand healthier life because that grounding\nthat you have in community ends up being\nimportant for that.\n\nSo I think that aspect\nof social media, which is the ability to connect\nwith people, to understand what's going on\nin people's lives, have empathy for them,\ncommunicate what's going on with your life,\nexpress that, that's generally positive.", "but I think one thing that we have not accounted for is the cost of these changes right if we know what the costs are of certain actions we may still take those actions but we may find ways to mitigate the the costs we may in this case invest more in our relationships be more conscious about reaching out to other people going to visit at them uh but that has been a a quiet but but devastating Consequence the other piece with modernity is that we have more convenience in our life which means that we also don't need to see other people to get certain things done like buying groceries or mailing an item out or getting something from the store I can sit in the comfort of my home and have everything just come to me now on the one hand that's incredibly efficient right but I think efficiency is an interesting thing because it's only one factor we should be considering in our lives there too we have to ask the cost and one interesting thing about Co is many people in the first year of Co when we were all separated from one another you know when we finally came back together again I had so many people who said to me you know what I expected to miss my parents and my siblings and my friends not being able to see them what I didn't expect was missing the strangers that I saw at the coffee shop or the folks who I ran into the grocery store or seeing neighbors as I walked down the street like I actually missed that more than I thought I would so we have lost out on some of those interactions and those loose ties but the final thing to keep in mind also is about what is happening with how we are using social media technology which I think is fundamentally transformed how we interact with one another and how we see ourselves and each other and this is particularly true for young people uh who are growing up as digital natives but what has happened there I worry is that and and it's not that social media is all bad just to be clear you know technology look I'm I'm a believer that in technology broadly speaking you know I'm a user of technology I spent seven years building a tech company I'm a Believer in Tech", "And nowadays, we hear\na lot about how online, we are connected but we're not really...\n\nWhat is it?\n\nWe're communicating but we're not connected

standing in the same space or playing sports together,\nenjoying music together, enjoying meals together\nis vitally important, there's an entire generation, or several generations of people that are coming up who\nmuch of their social interaction has been online.\n\nAnd if you think about it, all of the things that\nwe've spelled out earlier about common mental narrative, this left-brain system

Answer: 

Nutrition and adaptogens play a significant role in affecting well-being by helping to buffer stress and support overall health. Adaptogens are compounds that help the body adapt to and cope with stress, ultimately supporting cellular health, organ function, and overall daily living, including sleep and mental health.

One of the primary sources of adaptogens is nutrition, particularly through the consumption of dark leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables. These foods contain vitamins and micronutrients that act as powerful adaptogens, reducing reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines. It's recommended to include at least two to four servings of these vegetables per day for optimal benefits. However, it's important to note that excessive heating of these vegetables can destroy some of the beneficial nutrients, so careful preparation is key.

Adaptogens can have a significant impact on the body's stress response, primarily by modulating cortisol levels. Cortisol, a key stress hormone, should ideally be high in the morning and taper off throughout the day. Adaptogens can help regulate this pattern, especially when cortisol levels are chronically elevated or peak too late in the day, which has been associated with various mental and physical health issues.

Some specific adaptogens mentioned include ashwagandha, lion's mane, and chaga. These supplements can be particularly beneficial during periods of high stress, such as during demanding work or school periods, family changes, or recovery from illness or injury. They can be used for short periods, typically two to three weeks, to help buffer the stress response.

It's worth noting that while adaptogens can have indirect effects on neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin through their impact on cortisol, there is little evidence of direct modulation of these neurotransmitters.

Lastly, it's crucial to remember that behavioral adaptogens are equally important. While the context doesn't provide specific examples, it emphasizes that behaviors, along with nutrition, are the two main categories of adaptogens that should be considered first.

In conclusion, a combination of proper nutrition rich in natural adaptogens, targeted use of adaptogenic supplements when needed, and the implementation of stress-buffering behaviors can significantly contribute to overall well-being by helping the body better manage and adapt to stress.

in order to help you sleep\nbetter to improve cellular function for\nlongevity sports performance, cognitive performance,\nthat is all good and it makes sense\nwhy people would be interested in adaptogens.\n\nBut remember that the\ntwo main adaptogens that you should think\nto first are going to be behaviors and nutrition.\n\nI started with\nnutrition on purpose.\n\nAs I mentioned, we'll get\nto behaviors in a moment.\n\nSo if you're interested\nin adaptogens at all, I highly recommend that\nyou include at least two to four servings of\ndark, leafy greens and/or cruciferous\nvegetables per day.\n\nI think that would be\nhighly advantageous.\n\nAnd just be aware that\nexcessively heating dark, leafy greens or\ncruciferous vegetables can actually destroy\nthe very nutrients and micronutrients that\nact in an adaptogenic way.\n\nThat does not mean that you\nneed to eat raw broccoli or cauliflower, just the thought\nof that makes me nauseous, it's very hard to digest.\n\nSome people might like that\nor can digest it more easily than others.", 'OK.\n\nSo I probably\nsurprised some people by starting off my answer\nto the question of "What are adaptogens?\n\nAre they worth thinking\nabout in pursuing?\n\nAnd if so, how can I get\nthem?"\n\nby talking about food.\n\nBut I think it is important\nto understand that you can get a lot of adaptogens from food.\n\nAnd indeed, some of\nthe best adaptogens do come from dark leafy greens\nand cruciferous vegetables.\n\nSo I\'d be remiss if I\ndidn\'t mention that.\n\nThe other two\ncategories of adaptogens are going to be supplement-based\nadaptogens and then behavioral adaptogens.\n\nAgain, here adaptogen\ndefined as anything that can buffer stress in a\nsubstantial or meaningful way in order to support\ncellular health, organ health, and overall daily\nliving and functioning, including sleep and\nperformance in mental health.\n\nSo the second\ncategory of adaptogens are going to be supplements.\n\nAnd here, again, I just\nwant to take a step back, make sure that we\nare clear about our operational definition\nabout what a supplement is.', "The first question today\nis about adaptogens.\n\nSome of you may have\nheard of adaptogens.\n\nI'm guessing many of you\nhave not heard of adaptogens.\n\nThe strict definition of\nadaptogens is still evolving.\n\nMeaning, no one really\nknows what adaptogens mean and what's included\nin adaptogens and what's excluded\nfrom adaptogens.\n\nBut the most common\ndefinition of an adaptogen is a compound that is typically\na supplement or a drug.\n\nAlthough, it could be a\nbehavior, if you really think about it, that helps you\nadapt to and buffer stress.\n\nSo when you hear\nabout adaptogens, there are three main\ncategories of adaptogens that come to mind.\n\nThe first are things that\nare contained in food.\n\nSo these would be\nvitamins or micronutrients that one could\neasily find in food.\n\nBut one would have to consume\na fairly restricted number or type of foods in order\nto obtain those things, or consume a lot of\nthose foods in order to get sufficient dosages\nof those adaptogen compounds in order to buffer stress.\n\nSome good examples\nof these would be any kind of vitamin, either\nwater-soluble or fat-soluble, that can adjust or reduce what\nare so-called reactive oxygen species.\n\nAnd then that's what\ngives rise to this idea that antioxidants\nare good for us.", "The second part of\nthe question was what does the scientific\nevidence say about adaptogens and their ability to mediate\nbody stress response?\n\nThey say quite a\nlot, and they say that the stress response can\nbe buffered substantially by certain adaptogens.\n\nMainly, dark leafy greens,\ncruciferous vegetables, ashwagandha, lion's\nmane, and chaga, and of course, all\nthe behavioral things that are critical that I\nwill list off in a moment.\n\nAnd then the third\nportion of the question is, is there any\nsolid evidence that has an effect on\nneurotransmitters or the HPA, which is part of the\nstress modulation access?\n\nThe best evidence is that\nadaptogens can reduce cortisol itself.\n\nThere is very little evidence\nthat adaptogens can directly modulate neurotransmitters or\nneuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, et cetera.\n\nBut by adjusting the timing\nand levels of cortisol, especially in the\nafternoon and evening, that is going to have\nindirect effects on levels of dopamine, norepinephrine,\net cetera, and serotonin.\n\nBut not direct effects.", "So nowadays, you'll hear\nabout reactive oxygen species and antioxidants, but not\nas much as you used to.\n\nNow, you hear a lot more\nabout inflammatory responses and inflammatory cytokines\nalso being an issue.\n\nAnd the truth is all of\nthese things are an issue.\n\nSo going back to this\nquestion about adaptogens, adaptogens include\nthese three categories.\n\nI've told you the first,\nwhich are the vitamins and micronutrients that\nare contained in food that can reduce reactive\noxygen species and other aspects\nof cell or stress, such as inflammatory cytokines.\n\nWhat are some of those\nthings that occur in foods?\n\nWell, in order to\nanswer that, let's just think about what\nsorts of foods, themselves, can act as adaptogens.\n\nIt's commonly held that the\ndark, leafy greens type foods, for those of you\nthat eat plants.\n\nAnd I think the majority of\npeople out there do eat plants.\n\nI know that the\ncarnivore diet and lion diet and some other diets\ntend to exclude plants, and we'll address that\nbriefly at some point in today's discussion.\n\nBut dark, leafy greens\nare known to contain a number of compounds\nin the form of vitamins and micronutrients that are\nvery effective in reducing reactive oxygen species\nand inflammatory cytokines.", "In the context of\nadaptogens, there are two or three\nin particular that can be very beneficial\nfor buffering the stress response, especially,\nover short periods of time of about two to three weeks.\n\nSo when would you use these?\n\nWell, for instance, if you are\nin a particularly stressful mode of life, either because of\nfamily or relational or school or work demands or\nnew kid in the house or-- any number of different\nthings, or you've been ill or you're recovering\nfrom injury, taking an adaptogen in\nthe form of a supplement can actually be very useful\nfor buffering this hormone and the general system\nis associated with, called cortisol.\n\nIt's very healthy\nto have high levels of cortisol early in the day,\nshortly after you wake up.\n\nAnd then that ought to taper\noff toward the afternoon and evening.\n\nHowever, if cortisol\nis chronically elevated throughout the day,\nor if that peak in cortisol is arriving too late\nin the day, that is known to be associated\nwith mental health and physical health issues.\n\nHas been shown by labs at\nStanford and elsewhere.\n\nIt's been shown in animal\nmodels and in humans.", "but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress

Answer: 

Smartphones have significantly impacted knowledge productivity in various ways. On the positive side, they provide instant access to vast amounts of information. As mentioned in one of the Huberman Lab YouTube videos, smartphones allow quick access to specific knowledge, such as medical dosage information, which can be helpful in professional settings. This easy access to facts and data can potentially enhance productivity by reducing the need to memorize every piece of information.

However, the impact of smartphones on learning and comprehension is more complex. Research discussed in the Huberman Lab podcast indicates that reading comprehension is significantly poorer when using smartphones compared to reading on paper. This study found that physiological sighs, which are important for learning and memory consolidation, occur less frequently when reading on smartphones, potentially affecting the depth of understanding and retention of information.

In terms of focus and productivity, smartphones present a double-edged sword. While they can be useful tools for accessing information and staying connected, they also introduce significant distractions. The constant notifications and easy access to various apps can lead to frequent task-switching, which is detrimental to deep focus and productivity. As discussed in the podcast, the ability to demonstrate effort at a very fine-grained level through constant communication (via email, Slack, etc.) has led to a culture of "pseudo-productivity," where being busy is often conflated with being truly productive.

Moreover, smartphones can contribute to what's termed "solitude deprivation." This concept, explained in the podcast, refers to the lack of time spent free from stimuli created by other human minds. Constant connectivity through smartphones can lead to mental exhaustion and increased anxiety, as our brains are constantly engaged in processing social information.

To optimize the use of smartphones for knowledge productivity, several strategies were suggested in the Huberman Lab discussions:

1. Set boundaries: Decide beforehand how and when you'll use your smartphone during work or study sessions.
2. Create phone-free periods: Implement times where you completely separate yourself from your phone to allow for deep focus and "solitude" for your mind.
3. Use smartphones intentionally: Instead of constant, reflexive use, be purposeful about when and how you engage with your device.
4. Leverage useful features: Utilize productivity apps or features that enhance learning and organization, while being mindful of potential distractions.

In conclusion, while smartphones can boost knowledge productivity by providing quick access to information, their impact on deep learning, focus, and overall productivity is mixed. The key lies in intentional and balanced use, leveraging the benefits while mitigating the potential drawbacks.

Reports.\n\nThis is an excellent journal\nNature Press journal, Peer Reviewed, et cetera, and the finding center around what sorts of devices we\nhappen to be reading on and accessing information on and how that\'s impacting our physiology and our capacity to learn.\n\nOne of the more frequent questions I get is what are all these\ndevices, phones, tablets, computers, video games et cetera, doing

did differ.\n\nAnd that particular\nfeature is what we call physiological sighs.', "Etc that's fine if you need your phone but to the extent that you can remove yourself from distractions that's certainly going to en enhance your ability to focus on what you need to focus on in pursuing your goals that sort of stands without saying it's kind of a duh and yet I think a lot of people are searching far and wide for the productivity app for the secret hack for the thing that's going to allow them to be Pro productive and oftentimes there are DOs actions that we can take in order to become more productive we're talking about some of those today we've talked about those in other episodes but there are of course important don't so don't have your phone facing up with Wi-Fi and Celler service on if you want to be productive at something that doesn't evolve your phone ideally you'll turn it over you'll turn it off you'll get rid of it you'll put it in the Next Room if you're like me you'll sometimes lock it in the car I think the most extreme that I've ever gone to ensure that I didn't um engage with my phone during goal Pursuit was during the early days of having my laboratory and I was writing multiple grants in parallel which is an immense amount of work I would walk into the lab labatory in the morning and I would hand a student or postto my phone and I'd say don't give this back to me until 5:00 p.m.\n\nand if I ask for it back if I even ask for it once everyone in the lab gets $500 there were quite a few people in my lab and so it's a significant cost to that and I must tell you there were numerous times throughout the day when I impulsively just thought okay I'm going need my phone damn it I don't want to have to do it", "but but for one of the other negative effects right so we have the positive effects you talked about which is consolidation of learning and acceleration of learning we had the one negative effect which was the pavlovian connection to distraction the other I've written about before is Solitude deprivation right so so I'm using a different definition of solitude than the colloquial one most people think of it as a physical thing I'm I'm just isolated but there's a there's a cognitive psychological definition of solitude which means absence of stimuli created by other human Minds right so I'm not taking in information that's coming directly from another human mind uh having no period with this Solitude so having no period in your day where your free from stimuli creative from other Minds is Solitude deprivation and it's a real issue and partially it's a real issue because when we're processing input from another human brain it's all hands- on Deck right I mean we're very social beings a huge portion of our brain is dedicated to this right um so it's a very cognitively expensive activity when I'm trying to understand another human's what they're saying I'm simulating their mental state I'm trying to understand like where do they fall in this sort of social hierarchy and one of my arguments was um when you spend your entire day in that state it's exhausting and anxiety producing and like until we had smartphones and ubiquitous wireless internet the idea that you could banish all Solitude from your day is laughable it's just impossible right so of course we had a lot of portions of our day where our brain was not like ramped up in gear four like the sort of social processing mode but smartphones makes it possible that you can be in that mode all day long and so like one of the things I hypothesize is some of the anxiety Rises that goes with the age of smartphones is brain exhaustion right so that's like that's another negative effect of the const we have two negative effects now for the constant stimuli and one positive effect for the absence of the constant stimula so I think we're making a case here for not always being on your device", "so I I point to that it's that 5-year period 2010 to 2015 which I've called the Great rewiring of childhood because it affects everything everything about what children and teenagers are doing I can recall in 2010 I was actually in New York City visiting friends I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting yeah nowadays I think of it less as addicting but almost um like an an OCD of sorts and here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD but the interesting thing about OCD is that the compulsions the behaviors don't serve to reduce the obsessions rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them and in many ways I feel like smartphone use and social media use in particular is a OCD of sorts it's not just habit it's not just an addiction it's an obsessive compulsive Loop so it's already a struggle to pay attention and you know ancient Traditions have have taught techniques to improve your focus your attention we're easily distracted and um you know so I don't work on my phone very much because I I hate to type on the phone and and I'm always at a computer but even for me sitting at my computer as soon as the thinking gets hard as soon as if I'm writing if I'm doing something that requires concentration some little part of my brain says I wonder what the weather's going to be and I go check the weather or you know oh did I get any email I go check my I might check my email you know probably 40 50 times a day and I know that's terrible so the question is is it a compulsion where I feel pulled I have to check it or something bad will happen no it's more like imagine trying to do your work imagine trying to be a kid in school and you have on your desk in front of you you have your television set your record player a walkie talk to talk to your friends a guitar a painting set all array in front of you and your teacher is telling you about you know geometry what are you going to do probably one of these things and so I think the smartphone where a flip phone it's it's a tool you pull it out if you want to talk to someone then you put it away but the smartphone there's no reason to ever put it away talk to us about the scary statistics there's just no way around this yeah", "so I think it was a real quandry my argument is what essentially the management class came up with is p productivity which is okay in the absence of being able to be quantitative about this we will use visible activity as a proxy for useful effort so that's it like we see you doing things that's better than not the more we see you doing the better I call that pseudo productivity and I think that's implicitly how we've been organizing the management of knowledge work labor since the 1950s and when you say ability at people doing things this is the um conflating of busyness with actual productivity yes and so the problem came when we had this uh General way of measuring approximating productive effort which wasn't very good but whatever right I mean I want to see you're at the office and you're doing things the problem was the front office it Revolution right because I'm I'm essentially a techn Critic I see everything through the lens of technology in my writing we got computers we got networks we got email pseudo productivity can't be be sustainable in that context because now with something like email and then later tools like slack I can demonstrate effort at a very fine grain right because I can send an email respond to this jump onto a slack conversation I can now do that at a very fine grain level um and essentially everywhere and anywhere all throughout my day I can be demonstrating labor at home I can be demonstrating labor because we have mobile Computing we get the smartphone Revolution um so there there's now an ability to constantly be demonstrating effort at all points of our day and that's where I think the wheels came off the bus right and and led to this this this point that got worse and worse starting the early 2000s and hit ahead in the pandemic of knowledge worker burnout knowledge worker exhaustion and nihilism of like what's going on with my job like all I do is zoom all day what's happening I think that pseudo productivity plus front office it Revolution they did not play nice together and you can see this by the way if you look even at productivity books you see this huge shift that happens early 90s versus early 2000s it's like a completely shift in tone right early 90s it's stepen cvy is very optimistic it's like how are we going to self-actualize and like carefully choose the most meaningful activities to fulfill all of our dreams for all of our roles early 2000s now we have email you have David Allen that's like", "the circuits for focus and attention themselves are subject to neuroplasticity and then the third question is can you name or List off in your mind three tools that the most effective students have been shown to use I can think of limiting distraction by virtue of putting away phones and telling others you won't be in contact with them two and I'm getting these out of order I realize is to isolate to study alone and the third that I can recall is to teach others in the same course okay you can probably think of a few others now why are we taking these silly little quizzes Well turns out they're not so silly when one considers that hopefully you'll remember the information from today so that you don't have to listen to it over and over again but that if ever there was a strongly research supported tool in the literature in the peer-reviewed literature about how students can learn information better it's testing and I know I know", "i' I've develop many good habits because of you thank you thank you you look very healthy and um delighted to have you here I'm a longtime fan of your work I've read the cuddling of the American mind it's an incredibly important book The anxious generation incredibly important book I'll just start off with an easy question which is how are we doing as a species ah how are we doing as a species well as a species as one of my friends said you know we're going to be pretty hard to kill off we'll be like cockroaches and you know we're pretty inventive in that way uh but as a civilization I think we might well be at a point of there are Peaks and valys and there are some Cycles in history and we uh may be at one of those turning points and uh it's going to be pretty unclear what happens over the next five or 10 years um it's a very interesting time to be a social scientist I'll just leave it at that I suppose we can't point to any one factor but we wouldn't be sitting here today you wouldn't have written in the anxious generation and it wouldn't be having the incredible impact that it's having were it not for the fact that smartphones have dramatically profoundly changed the way that we interact as a species in fact a colleague of mine at Harvard Jeff lickman who's world famous for neuroplasticity said a few years back you know this is probably the first time in human history that humans have written with their thumbs implying that the brain representation of the thumbs is probably very different in all of us um than it was uh prior to that because the brain is an Adaptive map of of our experience in many ways that's a somewhat innocuous example of the changes that have occurred the use of the digits uh the thumbs uh to write but there's so much more going on now as a consequence of smartphone", "Etc um some of the protocols as we'll call them are incredibly easy to Implement others take some discipline so I'd like to talk about both sets today but the first question I have is um do you own a smartphone I do have a smartphone yeah well here's the thing I don't use social media so it turns out smartphones aren't that interesting if you don't have any social media apps on it yeah what's that like so there's there's nothing if you have nothing that is engineered to try to grab your attention the smartphone actually goes back to 2007 Steve Jobs keynote address smartphone which is the is a really nice phone and your music you can listen to things on it and uh the phone interface is really good and look there's a Maps app and you can like look at maps on it like it's actually a useful piece of technology that you're happy to have but uh you don't use it that much what about text messaging do you text message and if so do you get into conversations by text or is it more of a a plan and meet type tool uh I try right so so I try I do use text messaging I mean this is how like my wife gets in touch with uh but I'm notorious somewhat among my friends of my the ability to capture my attention with text messages really hit or miss because I'll go hours without looking at my phone", "and I'm not calling them adaptive or maladaptive they're clearly here to stay they've assisted in medicine I'm sure it makes it easier for doctors to communicate on the on the ward and and for um clinic and it's so useful right but contained in the small device um there are things like uh for instance text messaging where unlike 20 years ago we can have four or five different conversations very quickly while boarding a flight um there's a task switching element that was just not present in our life um prior to that um social media in particular this notion of being able to scroll so move if we really step back from this move one's thumb and access hundreds if not thousands of video content from dist which Each of which has a distinct context um and so I have to imagine that kids and adults have frontal coures that are learning these rules and the rule rule is move your thumbs stay engaged emotions either positive veence emotions or negative emotions I mean it's it's a fairly limited um landscape there when you really think about it", "um I spent a lot of time studying that closely right from like a techn critic standpoint the introduction of digital communication to the workplace and the problem there is the reason why we're checking this all the time it's not some like individual habit deoptimization it's not oh I should just check this less often what happened is when we introduce low friction digital communication to the office this emerging consensus came about that said great let's just use ad hoc messaging as our major way of collaborating like we can just figure things out on the fly I can just be like Andrew what's going on with the whatever and you can answer me and I can send it back um this was very convenient the activation cost was low and so this is how we began actually collaborating on work now what happens is as workloads get higher we now have many things at the same time they're all generating these asynchronous back and forth conversations most of these have some sort of time sensitivity right so if I email you and say like what's going on with like the guest coming later today we have to kind of resolve this before later today um so now it's not just that these messages are going back and forth with all these different threads", "but you know what's more effective telling students at the outset of class or telling yourself at the outset of any kind of learning Expedition because this isn't just about the classroom that you're going to take a bunch of exams that you're going to use testing or quizzes whatever you want to call them as a form of teaching and learning and that you can expect five tests or five quizzes during the course of being presented the material or that you are going to test yourself every day after the material now sometimes you have to go from one class to the next class there isn't an opportunity to test yourself but guess what's not going to be helpful walking out of class and getting immediately on to your phone we know that that probably inhibits your ability to remember the material because it's going to enhance forgetting because you do have this key opportunity right after being exposed to new material to help offset the forgetting by testing yourself on that material as soon as possible after being exposed to it so again even though I did not attend school in an era where we had smartphones and texting I recall walking out of class and just walking out of class and going to my bicycle but of course there were people to talk to there were other things to attend to if you're really serious about learning material take a few seconds maybe even a few minutes after being exposed to that material and think about that material test yourself on it and if you find that you don't know the material you're confused by it or overwhelmed by it great you just accomplished the first step in queuing your nervous system to the fact that it needs to learn that material and you've created an opportunity for enhanced neuroplasticity which is really what all of the stuff about testing as a form of studying is about you're going to test yourself so that you figure out what you don't know so that you then look up that material test yourself on it again so that ultimately you forget very little of it if any now there are other components to learning and neuroplasticity that I've talked about on previous podcast that are just too interesting not to mention",

recently my podcast team was in Australia and um my producer and uh close friend here uh Rob Moore uh instructed all of us to get rid of social media on our phones except one guy who would post our

friction coming back to it um and I think for people listening to this I I raise this because I think of course many people listening are you know have work that they really need to focus on they may

Answer: 

Kids face significant pressures regarding smartphones and social media, particularly when it comes to age limits and peer influence. These pressures stem from both social norms and the widespread adoption of these technologies among young people.

One of the main pressures kids face is the feeling of being left out if they don't have a smartphone or access to social media platforms. As Dr. Jonathan Haidt points out, "every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone." This creates a collective action trap where parents feel compelled to provide smartphones to their children at increasingly younger ages.

The age limits for social media platforms also create pressure. While the legal age for most platforms is 13, many kids find ways to circumvent these restrictions. Dr. Haidt suggests that the current age limit of 13 is problematic, as there's "barely any forebrain at 13." He advocates for raising the age limit to 16 and implementing stronger age verification measures.

Peer influence plays a significant role in kids' desire for smartphones and social media access. Dr. Vivek Murthy, the U.S. Surgeon General, notes that if a child is "the only one who's not on social media in your middle school class, then you might feel left out." This social pressure can be intense, making it challenging for parents to enforce restrictions.

The impacts of smartphones and social media on kids' behavior and mental health are concerning. Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felsher mentions that while smartphones have increased risk behavior in some ways, it's more about "the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out." Social media platforms can amplify negative experiences, such as bullying or embarrassing moments, which can now "go viral" and have more far-reaching consequences than in the pre-smartphone era.

Mental health is a significant concern. Dr. Murthy reports that "nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image" and that for adolescents who use social media for 3 hours or more daily, "their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double."

Parents face the challenge of balancing these pressures with concerns about their children's well-being. Some are adopting strategies like delaying smartphone access or implementing usage restrictions. Dr. Cal Newport, for instance, mentions that he doesn't allow his children to have smartphones, anticipating that they might "hate me now, love me later."

In conclusion, kids face substantial pressures regarding smartphones and social media, driven by peer influence, social norms, and the fear of missing out. These pressures often conflict with age restrictions and parental concerns about mental health and development, creating a complex landscape for both children and parents to navigate.

Retrieved Contexts: ["so yes there is some evidence that overall phones and smartphones have increased risk behavior but it's more the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "so you can have two parents who are married and living in the same home and may or may not be a good relationship but living in the same home if there's no conflict or that then generally teens will do well or as you're saying there's not necessarily a direct correlation the problem comes in whether parents are living at home together or separated or divorced is if there's conflict and then that conflict tends to result in social issues emotional issues a lot of social anxiety a lot of feeling like I need to do better so that way my parents like me more and we see that with children too that's not just adolescence a lot of depression and with depression can come self-medication and uh self-medicating around other drugs and so on but that generally is resolved if the conflict resolves but as you're saying we're seeing adolescent angst regardless of parenting uh what we really need though it's not a matter of just the divorce or not divorce or the relationship between the parents it's parenting that's important so parents being good monitors being involved in their kids' lives not this oh you're 16 you have a car you can go wherever you want and we're not going to keep an eye on you we still need parents to monitor to pay attention to find out their kids' friends where are they going after school that discretionary time when parents are working and teenagers come home between 3 and 5 or 3 and six tends to be the most risky couple of hours they're it's called discretionary hours where there's no parent around and we don't always know where those teenagers are hanging out so that's more important knowing where their children are and what they're doing and that there's some adult presence some monitoring then whether or not they're still in a relationship my sense is that smartphones have allowed more communication and monitoring between parents and kids but also more interactions between kids and other kids and kids and adults more broadly so is there any evidence that uh the Advent of smartphones is directly creating problems for kids that um has to do with just so much more PE PE to peer interaction or peer to-peer exposure like when I was growing up we didn't have smartphones uh if you did something stupid like that meaning that kids would laugh at it might get told to a small group of people maybe a larger group of people but um in general it just kind of didn't go anywhere you're like a I screwed up and then You' get teased a bit and then it would kind of dissipate", "oh these terrible devices um rather it's about a vision of childhood which is actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the reason why I got this far is because it's a set of collective action traps everyone every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone so the four recommendations I have are four ways of breaking out on the Trap but the first two are really about delaying and getting past this period of plasticity and you really help me see why it's so urgent to delay until late puberty at least so here are the four Norms that I think can break us out of this trap Norm number one uh no smartphone before high school you can give your kid a flip phone flip the Millennials had flip phones they came out fine no access or no smartphone of their own your own you can't have your own and that would even go for an iPad if you give your kid an iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it any you know anywhere in the house and you can take it outside even although maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the point is um the internet is an amazing thing and you know you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids and they can do things on the computer but you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to so it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone let them have a flip phone or a simple phone watch something like that that's rule number one rule number two is the most relevant for what we're just talking about and that is no social media until 16 there is I believe no way to make social media safe for children that is if they're going to be entering a domain in which Prestige is gained by having posts that get the most likes and followers you're making them be brand managers you're making them be performative this is not playful th", "I think you'd have much better outcomes if that's part of what you learned at the University was how to take the thing in your head and really put it to work you know really extract out of it his capabilities or even high school or even Elementary School level I agree you U you have kids yeah um do they have smartphones no yeah how do they feel about that well I mean they're not they're not old enough yet that it's a it's a real problem um but they're they're not going to be having happy with me probably soon hate me now love me later as my mother used to say basically because I you know I'm I'm convinced having spent some time thinking about this writing about this doing some journalism on this talking to a lot of the experts that like I think where we're going to end up where all the the arrows from the the relevant social psych research which um I've been following This research since you know 2017 this is 2017 is roughly when you see the first warning signs going up that we need to worry about the potential mental health impact of these tools especially social media and smartphones on young people and I you can track this right I have a talk I I actually gave it my kids school not happy about this where I tracked how this research evolved and you know like any literatures it's contentious at first", 'So,\n- Right.', "It's like-\n- Right. - Well-\n-", 'Like so-\n-', '- Yeah-\n-', 'But-\n-', "but we just need a norm now for for raising the age to 16 we can struggle to do that I'm doing that with my kids I'm saying no for my daughter no Snapchat till you're 16 16 um and she's the only one who doesn't have it it's painful for her and she's 14 um but my hope is that no parent again will be in that situation that in every school a lot of the parents are going to say no no social media till 16 now of course the laws currently state that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract give away your data and make a deal with a company without your parents knowledge or permission but Congress passed this terrible law in 1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy protection act it was supposed to set the age to 16 which is not which is I think pretty reasonable but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement it's the law is written such that as long as the company doesn't absolutely know that you're underage they're fine they're not responsible 13 they're motivated the companies are now the law motivates the companies to not know how old children are there's barely any forbrain at 13 that's right that's right and since all you have to do you just have to be old enough to lie about your age if you're old enough to lie about your age you can go anywhere on the internet because there's no enforcement so I'm saying let's take the age of 13 which is not enforced let's require age verification which is complicated but they're working on that in Britain they've they're mandating that it's going to happen in Britain we'll work out the technical details um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's the one place where I think we really do need law uh because social media is a social trap and if half the kids are on it there's going to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws", "it it's it's cropping up in different ways I'm meeting more and more some of these are organized efforts but I'm also meeting more uh families uh where the parents and kids together have decided that they're going to delay using social media and you know till past middle school or in some cases even later or where they're deciding that they're going to draw boundaries around social media use or they're going to replace their smartphone with a dumb phone that allows them to do things like text and make phone calls and use maps and and all that stuff but doesn't necessarily have social media apps on it now this is still a small minority and and we're dealing with a bit of a network effect here right because if you're the only one who's not on social media uh in your middle school class then you might feel left out which is why it's so important for parents to and and kids actually do this together", "so you know it is important to clean up the content but for kids going through puberty I think the only real answer is just delay just don't let them do that how much of the issue here is modeling of what adults are doing and um you know and how terrible are or good are adults at modulating their behavior I say modulating because you know I see a lot of parents um videotaping everything that they're you know on the phone all the time in line at the store while their kids are around you know and one of the reasons I think parents like divices so much is that it's a terrific uh lowc cost zero cost um babysitter it allows them to then go be on their phones or do other things yeah so young children are sometimes copying their parents young children are looking for things to copy uh and you know and so I I've got some slides in my regular book lecture of toy iPhones that we give to to ERS so they can be just like Mommy and Daddy um for little kids I think it might matter for teenagers you know I'm very often asked that question because and I think it's because parents they feel a little guilty like they know that they're modeling bad behavior and they're worried like is this setting up my kid for doing that and I can't say for sure but my intuition as a social psychologist is not really not very much and the reason is because you know while your kids once looked up to you and they once copied you like by the time they're 12 13 14", "but now of course that can propagate very very far very fast is there any evidence that that mere fact is creating issues for for kids so I would say it's not a blanket statement I think it depends on the behavior that we're talking about bullying no doubt the example that you gave no doubt that if you mess up if you do something stupid it's getting filmed and it's going to go viral it will go on social media and then it will perpetuate and escalate amongst the peers um that we definitely know is happening and certainly in terms of drug use and marketing there there's def some peer-to-peer interaction look how cool I am look at the Smoke Ring I did look at other things that I've been doing there there is no doubt but in general there are also some good things about it parent communication they can monitor where their children are they can put a tracker on the phone uh I know with my own kids sometimes it was the best way to say you seem a little sad when face-to-face communication wasn't happening I could use the the phone to have that conversation", "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media"]

Ground Truths: ['Kids face significant pressure regarding smartphones and social media due to peer influence, as every 10-year-old feels the need to have a smartphone because their peers do. This creates a social trap where children do not want to be left out or alone, leading to a collective action problem. Additionally, there is pressure to engage in social media, with the recommendation that no social media should be allowed until the age of 16 to mitigate these pressures.']

Answer: 

Dynamic subordination is a key element that enhances resilience and accountability in Seal Team members during high-stakes scenarios. This concept involves a flexible leadership structure where team members can take over leadership roles as different skill sets are required, regardless of their official rank or position.

In Seal Teams, this approach allows for decentralized command, which is considered one of their absolute strengths. It means that there are leaders at every level of the organization who are capable of making decisions and taking action even without explicit orders. This adaptability is crucial in high-stakes scenarios where quick thinking and decisive action can make the difference between success and failure.

The dynamic nature of this subordination system fosters resilience by ensuring that the team can continue to function effectively even if the designated leader is unavailable or incapacitated. It also promotes accountability, as each team member knows they may need to step up and lead at any moment, encouraging them to stay alert, engaged, and prepared.

This system is reinforced by a culture of being "relentlessly hard on each other," which includes both humor and serious critique. This constant feedback loop helps maintain high standards and ensures that each member is continually improving and ready to take on leadership roles when needed.

The effectiveness of dynamic subordination is also attributed to the trust it builds within the team. Members learn to rely on each other's skills and judgment, knowing that the most capable person for a specific task will take the lead. This trust is essential in high-stakes scenarios where teamwork and mutual support are critical.

It's worth noting that this approach is not unique to Seal Teams but exists in various male group dynamics. However, its implementation in Seal Teams is particularly refined and crucial due to the high-risk, high-consequence nature of their operations.

While the context doesn't provide specific examples of how this enhances resilience and accountability in actual high-stakes scenarios, it's clear that this system prepares Seal Team members to adapt quickly, make decisions under pressure, and take responsibility for their actions and those of their team.

something they like relentlessly hard at the level of humor but also I mean because it's so high cons high risk and high consequence they're just extremely hard on one another but it's all about this Dynamic subordination that sure they're leaders by virtue of who's appointed leader um and certain amount of authority but there's this constant Dynamic subordination and it exists in every group of males I've ever been a part of and it's wonderful and very reassuring to me because it means that you both get to potentially step up but you also get to rest when you and trust somebody else's skills I don't know how it operates with with girls I've only been um you know born with a Y chromosome this is all I know but um I imagine it exists there too in different but in different ways um so if online everything is fear-based where one is fearing a dog pile like if you say the wrong thing you're going to get dog piled you kind of wonder why anyone participates at all", "That's decentralized command.\n\nAnd that's something that\nexists in the SEAL teams without question, very\ndecentralized command.\n\nAnd that's one of the absolute\nstrengths of the SEAL teams is you've got leaders at every\nlevel inside the organization.\n\nThat if they don't\nknow exactly-- if they're not told what\nto do, they're going to go, OK, I haven't been\ntold what to do but I'm going to\ngo figure it out.\n\nAnd that's one of the\nstrengths of the SEAL teams.\n\nWe have more doctrine now, but\nwhen I came in the SEAL teams, there was no doctrine.\n\nIt was all word of mouth.\n\nAnd so the army and\nthe Marine Corps, if you have to\nconduct an ambush, you can pull out\na manual and you can look up how to conduct\nan ambush-- platoon ambush, how to conduct it-- and\nit's all written very clear.\n\nAnd they're great documents.\n\nThat's the FM 7-8 infantry\nplatoon and squad, I think is the army doctrine.\n\n- I can see the little neurons\nin your hippocampus firing in sequence.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- It's embedded\nin there forever.\n\n- And it's a great manual.\n\nAnd you can pull that\nthing out and you have a place to start from.\n\nIn the SEAL teams, we\ndidn't have that at all.\n\nSo you would hear from\nyour platoon chief, this is how you\nconduct an ambush.\n\nAnd he had heard it from his\nplatoon chief, who heard it from his platoon\nchief, who heard it from his platoon chief, and that\nplatoon chief was in Vietnam.\n\nSo it's getting passed down but\nyou can make adjustments to it.\n\nAnd you can alter the plan\na little bit because hey, the terrain is\ndifferent, or hey, the night vision we now have.\n\nSo there's changes\nthat we can make because there's no doctrine.", "so I think already once\nyou get to a SEAL Team, you've got people that\nare generally speaking, going to be pretty\nresilient when it comes to dealing with a loss.\n\nNot only that, I\nmean, you just get used to talk about\nlosing people, you're friends\nwith this guy, you meet this guy in SEAL\ntraining, hey, this guy seems like a stud, oh,\nhe's just going to quit.\n\nAnd you're going\nto lose five, six, seven people, eight people.\n\nPeople quit so fast you cant'\neven keep track of them.\n\nSo you're just going to lose.\n\nYou're just going\nto get used to it.\n\nSo there's that.\n\nNow once you're in\nthe Teams, what you're talking about is now you\nstart taking much more significant loss, you're\nnot losing a race, you're losing of\none of your friends.\n\nAnd this is what from a\nleadership perspective you have to pay attention to.\n\nSo when you're a leader\nin any organization, you're basically\nin charge of a mob.\n\nWhen it comes to what their\nmorale is, they're a mob, and they feed off\nof each other, just like a mob riding in\nthe streets going, oh, we can break this window.\n\nLet's break all the windows, and\nthey move this mob mentality.\n\nAnd that happens with\nmorale inside of a team.\n\nAnd you as a leader

through that program.\n\nSo as you know, this is an\nextremely rigorous program.\n\nAt the time it was only\nlike 10 or 20% of trainees.\n\n- Still is, the numbers have\nnever shifted from about

training cell at se team 3 and just some amazing people what I realized away was okay playtime is completely over and that was very useful like early lesson not that anyone was around in buds like you know it's serious but you meet a guy like Master Chief Martin who's got 100 combat missions from Vietnam he's about to retire he was like the third person I met when I checked into the team and you suddenly are like a kid again where there was just no around so you're in the teams presumably liking the work loved it loving the team component it's hard it's unpredictable and that's part of the the fun it's amazing yeah the job's amazing you do a number of different deployments MH and at some point you get called to try out for the tier one uh tier one division within the within the SEAL Teams um maybe just explain a little bit of what tier one means um and you know we don't want to speak in code here but we you know just inform people that there are levels within the teams um and that uh yeah tell us what tier one is yeah"]

Ground Truths: ['Dynamic subordination enhances resilience and accountability in Seal Team members by allowing individuals to take over leadership roles based on their skill sets as needed. This constant shift in leadership fosters a supportive environment where team members can step up when required and trust others to lead when they need to rest. The relentless support and high standards among team members create a culture of accountability, which is crucial in high-stakes scenarios.']

Answer: 

Outdoor play and independence have significantly different impacts on children's development compared to smartphone use. Historically, children had more play-based childhoods, which are crucial for healthy human development. This type of childhood allowed for independent adventures, learning self-supervision, and developing important social skills through unstructured playtime.

In contrast, today's children are experiencing what experts call a "phone-based childhood." On average, children spend about 5-7 hours a day on social media alone, with total screen time (including video games and other smartphone activities) reaching 7-10 hours daily. This extensive smartphone use is incompatible with healthy human development and drastically reduces the time children spend in outdoor, independent play.

The shift towards a phone-based childhood has several negative consequences:

1. Reduced physical activity and outdoor time
2. Less opportunity for independent problem-solving and risk assessment
3. Decreased face-to-face social interactions
4. Potential addiction to short-form video content due to quick reinforcement
5. Exposure to content from "random weirdos on the internet" for extended periods

On the other hand, outdoor play and independence offer numerous benefits:

1. Development of social skills through real-world interactions
2. Improved physical health and motor skills
3. Enhanced problem-solving abilities and risk assessment
4. Creation of lasting memories and experiences
5. Opportunities for self-directed learning and exploration

To address this issue, experts suggest several solutions:

1. Delaying smartphone ownership until high school
2. Prohibiting social media use until age 16
3. Implementing phone-free schools
4. Encouraging more independence, free play, and responsibility in the real world

Additionally, activities like summer camps and after-school sports (with agreed-upon no-phone policies) can provide protective effects against excessive smartphone use.

There's growing awareness of this issue, and some predict that within two years, attitudes towards children's smartphone use will change dramatically. This could lead to more children playing outside, riding bicycles, and engaging in real-world activities, similar to previous generations.

In conclusion, while smartphone use has become prevalent in children's lives, it cannot replace the crucial developmental benefits of outdoor play and independence. A shift back towards a more balanced childhood experience, with increased real-world interactions and reduced screen time, is essential for healthy child development.

marginally social media it's more of an general information Source but the point is especially the short videos the short videos are really really addictive because the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the house every day to go play my mom would say get out of the house I now realize she wanted space yeah", "I mean it's crazy what happens so eight states have now said no no more of that this is insane um so we so law could help to put to to stop incentivizing helicopter parenting to provide uh uh more spaces that are safe for kids to play in not car zones um so the book has the exas generation the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "um so I am I'm very very confident that childhood is going to look very different within two years I don't mean that it won't be seven-year-olds on phones but in the same way that we flipped on smoking we used to think it was okay to smoke in an airplane uh we used to think it was okay to smoke in restaurants it was okay to smoke everywhere we thought um and now we don't we don't think that anymore that took a long time to change but it did change I think because of the public disgust with seeing children just spending their childhood looking at a screen and because the public disgust with what we've heard about meta and and Tik Tok and a few of the other companies um I think within two years it's going to be widespread it'll be a norm that you just don't give kids social media in particular I mean iPads are complicated because you know you want kids you know to watch movies is okay stories are good I'm not saying the you know iPad is a terrible thing but um our attitudes about this are going to change radically um and I think the great majority of schools are going to be phone free within two years um and we're going to see we're already seeing more kids outside lot every day I get I get emails from Greatful parents saying you know because of your book me know my six-year-old he wanted to ride his bicycle down to the end of our cesac he wanted to ride down Circle and come back and I never would let him because I was afraid that what what would the neighbors say but once I read your book I decided to let him and he was so ecstatic he kept doing it and doing it and now he's going further and he rides to his friends houses so people in her neighborhood now they're seeing a kid on a bicycle and if Suppose there were 10 kids doing it well now it's normal so we can renormalize human childhood in the real world where our kids get the chance to have independent adventures and learn how to be self-supervised adults ultimately we can do this okay", "so that's the third Norm is uh no uh is phonefree schools you have to lock up the

can't help it they have to text if anyone's texting they have to be texting and the fourth Norm is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real

Independence and Adventure uh where they work out the conflicts themselves", "oh these terrible devices um rather it's about a vision of childhood which is actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the reason why I got this far is because it's a set of collective action traps everyone every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone so the four recommendations I have are four ways of breaking out on the Trap but the first two are really about delaying and getting past this period of plasticity and you really help me see why it's so urgent to delay until late puberty at least so here are the four Norms that I think can break us out of this trap Norm number one uh no smartphone before high school you can give your kid a flip phone flip the Millennials had flip phones they came out fine no access or no smartphone of their own your own you can't have your own and that would even go for an iPad if you give your kid an iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it any you know anywhere in the house and you can take it outside even although maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the point is um the internet is an amazing thing and you know you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids and they can do things on the computer but you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to so it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone let them have a flip phone or a simple phone watch something like that that's rule number one rule number two is the most relevant for what we're just talking about and that is no social media until 16 there is I believe no way to make social media safe for children that is if they're going to be entering a domain in which Prestige is gained by having posts that get the most likes and followers you're making them be brand managers you're making them be performative this is not playful th", "And when I was a kid we were allowed to watch TV for a certain number of I think it was a half an hour or an hour my mom was constantly kicking us out of the house like literally you got to leave the house you got to go down the street and play un fortunately I liked outdoor activities um nowadays we also have the issue that a lot of parents are on their phones at soccer games and at kids events and so the kids are modeling their parents yeah um parents are distracted as well so there's a lack of social connection people even an immediate family people are screened in um you know TV there's laptops there's multiple phones iPads people are you more engaged in the screen portals than often than their own portals you go to a concert and people are watching the concert through their screen so that they can send the same image that everyone around them is sending out to the world if you think about it's kind of crazy um but I guess they want to capture that unique experience", "I love what your mom did getting you guys outside um my parents did the same thing too like we I was very blessed to have two parents who didn't come you know they didn't have a lot of resources growing up they didn't come to this country with a lot of resources but the one of the greatest gifts they G gave us is that they loved us uncondition Al the other great gift that they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out"]

Ground Truths: ["Outdoor play and independence are essential for children's development, providing them with adventurous experiences and memories that are more meaningful than virtual interactions. The speaker emphasizes that children today need real adventures and independence rather than being confined to smartphones, which can lead to a lack of genuine experiences and conflict resolution skills. The contrast is drawn between the enriching experiences of outdoor play and the limitations imposed by smartphone use, suggesting that the latter does not foster the same level of growth and memory-making as outdoor activities."]

Answer: 

Compulsive behavior can have significant negative effects on individuals' emotional well-being. These effects are multifaceted and can be quite severe:

1. Increased anxiety and distress: Compulsive behaviors are often driven by intrusive thoughts or obsessions. While individuals engage in these behaviors to relieve anxiety, they ultimately reinforce and strengthen the obsessions, creating a cycle of increasing distress.

2. Shame and social isolation: Many people with compulsive behaviors experience intense shame, which can lead to social isolation. For example, those with bulimia may find it difficult to hide their vomiting behavior, leading to embarrassment and withdrawal from social interactions.

3. Impaired quality of life: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and related compulsive behaviors can significantly impact an individual's psychosocial functioning and overall quality of life. These behaviors can interfere with work, relationships, and daily activities.

4. Time consumption: Compulsive behaviors can be extremely time-consuming, taking away from other important aspects of life. This constant preoccupation with obsessions and compulsions leaves little time for activities that contribute to a rich, fulfilling life.

5. Cognitive interference: When individuals are focused on their obsessions and compulsions, they struggle to concentrate on other tasks. This divided attention can affect performance in work, school, and personal relationships.

6. Physical health consequences: In severe cases, compulsive behaviors can lead to physical harm. For instance, excessive hand washing in OCD can cause bleeding and raw skin, while purging behaviors in bulimia can lead to severe digestive tract issues.

7. Emotional dysregulation: Compulsive behaviors often stem from an inability to regulate emotions effectively. This can manifest as impulsivity, difficulty with delayed gratification, or extreme mood swings.

8. Persistent feelings of incompleteness: Individuals with compulsive behaviors may never feel satisfied that a task is completed adequately, leading to constant doubt and the need to repeat actions.

9. Reinforcement of negative patterns: Compulsive behaviors can create a cycle where individuals repeatedly enter similar situations or relationships, attempting to "fix" past traumas but ultimately reinforcing negative patterns.

In summary, compulsive behaviors can have a profound and pervasive impact on emotional well-being. They create a cycle of anxiety, shame, and impaired functioning that affects nearly every aspect of an individual's life, from their personal relationships to their ability to perform daily tasks. The constant struggle with intrusive thoughts and the need to perform compulsive actions can lead to significant emotional distress and a diminished quality of life.

compulsions you know that's it's not a formal term because because what we're really talking about is repetition right and we're interested like why why do we repeat things now that's one that's one reason right because we bring an unhealthy set of defenses and then at the end of the day things come out the same because we're bringing an unhealthy set of defenses right there can be other motivations that are related to all of that and there's again this complexity to it but but the compulsion part can be that we can re-enter situations that didn't go well with the idea that we're gonna we're gonna fix what happened in the past we're going to make ourselves feel better we're going to take away the mark of trauma because remember trauma doesn't care about the clock or the calendar so that's why you'll see someone who has had say five abusive relationships that looked very much the same right and is about to enter the sixth right and he said it's not because hopefully in most cases not because that person like wants to be hurt right I mean sometimes it's a different problem right but but there can be a drive inside of us to try and fix something if I can make it work this time I won't have to feel so bad about the other five right", "In any event, what they\ndid in this study is, or I should say what Susan Ahmari and colleagues did in this study was to stimulate the\ncortico-striatal circuitry in animals that did not\nhave any OCD-like behavior.\n\nAnd when they did that, those animals started grooming incessantly to the point where their hair\nwas falling out or they even, they didn't take the experiments\nthis far, fortunately, but the animals would have a tendency to almost rub themselves raw in the same way that\nsomebody who has a compulsion to hand wash would, sadly,\npeople will hand wash to the point where their hands are actually bleeding and raw.\n\nIt's really that bad.\n\nI know that's tough imagery to imagine, and you can't even imagine\nwhy someone would self harm in that way, but again,\nthat's that incredible anxiety relationship between the\ncompulsion, excuse me, the obsession and the compulsion, and the fact that\nengaging in the compulsion simply strengthens the obsession and therefore the anxiety.", "But it turns out that this recurrent and intrusive aspect of obsessions leads people with OCD to have checking repetition and/or order compulsions everywhere.\n\nSo whether or not somebody\nis at work or in school or trying to engage in sport or trying to engage in relationship or just something simple\nlike walking down the street, the obsessions are so\nintrusive that they show up and they compel people to\ndo things in that domain independent of whether or not they happen to be in\none location or another.\n\nIn other words, the thought patterns and the behaviors take\nover the environment as opposed to the environment driving the thought\npatterns and behaviors.\n\nSo it therefore becomes impossible to ever find a room that's clean enough, to find a bed that's made well enough, to find anything that's done well enough to remove the obsession.\n\nAnd I know I've said\nit multiple times now, but I'm going to say it many\ntimes throughout this episode in a somewhat obsessive, but I believe justified way that every time that one\nengages in the compulsion related to the obsession, the obsession simply becomes stronger.\n\nSo you can imagine what a powerful and debilitating loop that really is.", "Well some kids are able\nto delay gratification, some aren't and it's\ndebatable as to whether or not the kids that are able\nto delay gratification go on to have more\nsuccessful lives or not.\n\nInitially, that was the\nconclusion of those studies.\n\nThere's still a lot of debate about it, we'll bring an expert on to\ngive us the final conclusion on this 'cause there is one\nand it's very interesting and not intuitive.\n\nNonetheless, adults are also faced with decisions every day, all day as to whether or not they\ncan delay gratification.\n\nAnd this study used a, not\na two marshmallow task, but a game that involved rewards where people could delay in order to get greater rewards later.\n\nWhat is the conclusion?\n\nWell, first of all, obsessive-compulsive and obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder subjects both showed impairments in\ntheir psychosocial functioning and quality of life.\n\nThey had compulsive behavior.\n\nSo these are people that\nare suffering in their life because their compulsions\nare really strong.\n\nSo it's not just being really nit-picky or really orderly in one case and having full blown OCD in the other, both sets of subjects\nare challenged in life because they're having relationship issues or job-related issues, et cetera, because they are that compulsive.", "So the Yale-Brown Obsessive\nCompulsive Scale, this Y-BOCS, again, is very extensive, it goes on for dozens of pages actually, and has all these different categories, not so much designed to just pinpoint what people obsess about or what they feel compelled to do, but to also try and identify what is the fear that's driving all this.\n\nIn the way that we've\nset this up thus far, we've been talking about\nobsessions and compulsions is kind of existing in a vacuum.\n\nYou're obsessed about germs and you're compelled to wash your hands, obsessed about germs,\ncompelled to wash your hands.\n\nOr obsessed about symmetry, compelled to put right\nangles on everything.\n\nOr obsessed about counting and therefore counting, et cetera.\n\nBut beneath that is a cognitive component\nthat is not at all apparent from someone describing their obsession and from someone describing or\ndisplaying their compulsion.\n\nThe deeper layer to all\nthat is what is the fear, exactly, if one were to\nnot perform the compulsion, meaning what is the fear\nthat's driving the obsession?", "Let's talk about OCD or\nobsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nFirst of all, as the name suggests, OCD includes thoughts or obsessions and compulsions which are actions.\n\nThe obsessions and the\ncompulsions are often linked.\n\nIn fact, most of the time, the obsessions and the\ncompulsions are linked such that the compulsion, the behavior, is designed to relieve the obsession.\n\nHowever, one of the hallmark themes of obsessive-compulsive disorder is that the obsessions are intrusive.\n\nPeople don't want to have them.\n\nThey don't enjoy having them.\n\nThey just seem to pop into people's minds and they seem to pop into\ntheir mind recurrently.\n\nAnd the compulsions, unlike\nother sorts of behaviors, provide brief relief to the obsession, but then very quickly reinforce\nor strengthen the obsession.\n\nThis is a very key theme to realize about obsessive-compulsive disorder so I'm just going to repeat it again.\n\nThese two features, first,\nthe fact that the obsessions are intrusive and recurrent, as well as the fact that the\ncompulsions, the behaviors, provide, if anything, only\nbrief relief for the obsessions, but in most cases simply serve to make the obsessions stronger\nare the hallmark features of obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nAnd it turns out to be very important to keep these in mind as we go forward, not just because they define\nobsessive-compulsive disorder, but they also define\nthe sorts of treatments that will and will not work for obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "For instance, one of the\nthings that makes OCD so debilitating is, of course, the shame that we talked about before.\n\nBut it's also the fact that\nwhen people are focusing on their obsessions and their compulsions, they're not able to focus on other things.\n\nThat's simply the way\nthat the brain works.\n\nWe're not able to focus on\ntoo many things at once.", "Now, without listing off\nall the terrible things that happen with this binge purge cycle, there are a number of things that are really worth pointing out.\n\nOne is that the vomiting itself, the use of laxatives that\ncan cause severe disruption to the mucosal lining the mucus lining of the digestive tract\ncan severely disrupt the gut microbiome.\n\nIt can cause all sorts of even\na ulceration of the esophagus and just really terrible stuff.\n\nThere's a lot of shame\nassociated with bulimia, oftentimes because people are\nvomiting and it's hard to hide that vomiting behavior,\npeople are aware of it.\n\nThere's some social isolation.\n\nSo, you recall from the beginning, it does not appear that sexual trauma is a prerequisite for bulimia.\n\nAlthough sometimes it can\noccur the hallmark feature of bulimia that distinguishes\nit from anorexia, aside from the fact that\nit's overeating as opposed to under-eating is a lack of what they call inhibitory control.\n\nAnd that might come as no surprise.\n\nBut first of all, the bulimic, unlike the anorexic is hyper\nimpulsive and oftentimes has other types of impulse behaviors.\n\nThey might have a little bit of alcohol and then start to eat like crazy.\n\nWhereas normally they're very restrictive.\n\nThat's a common feature of bulimia, sometimes they over ingest\nalcohol during these binges.\n\nSometimes they are sexually\npromiscuous, not always, but it's a general issue with satiety once they start eating and\nwith impulse control generally.", "And it could be that hypomania or brief periods of mania,\nmaybe even an hour a day or 30 minutes a day of\ncomposing or writing poetry, maybe even some of the lows that we feel, some of the sadness, some of the grief, some of the nostalgia that we feel provided that it's not pathologic, that it's not persistent\nfor the four or seven days that are diagnostic of bipolar 2 and bipolar 1 disorder respectively, well, then we can start\nto view emotional states as something that can\nactually lend themselves to positive outcomes and\nmaybe even to creativity and to improved occupations.\n\nSo it's important that\nwe have a nuanced view of what sadness versus depression versus major depression are, it's important that we distinguish between being erratic, being very energized, and full blown bipolar disorder.\n\nAnd I raise this for\nanother reason as well.\n\nNowadays, it's very common to hear people saying, ah, you know, that person is OCD.\n\nWell, on the episode about OCD\nthat I did a few weeks back, that you can find if you\nlike at hubermanlab.com, in that episode, I pointed out that OCD, obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder is very maladaptive.\n\nI think it's number seven, as I recall on the list of debilitating diseases, all diseases in terms\nof lost time at work, suffering relationships, et cetera.", "The other thing is that\nOCD takes a lot of time out of people's lives.\n\nWith recurrent intrusive\nthoughts happening at very high frequency, or\neven at moderate frequency, people are spending a lot of\ntime thinking about this stuff and they're thinking about the behaviors they need to engage in, and\nthen engaging in the behaviors, which as I mentioned before, just serve to strengthen the compulsions and so they're not actually\ndoing the other things that make us functional human beings like commuting to work or doing homework or doing work or listening\nwhen people are talking or interacting or sports or working out, all the things that make\nfor a rich quality life are taken over by OCD in many cases.\n\nSo while that might be obvious to some, I'm not sure that it's\nobvious to everybody just how much time OCD can occupy.", "And then once you understand a little bit about the neural circuitry underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder, which we'll talk about in a few moments, then you will clearly understand why being a quote-unquote,\nobsessive person or having obsessive-compulsive personality is not the same as OCD.\n\nIn fact, we can leap ahead a little bit and compare and contrast OCD with obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder along one very particular set of features.\n\nAgain, I'll go into this\nin more detail later, but it's fair to say\nthat OCD is characterized by these recurrent and\nintrusive obsessions.\n\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nthe fact that those obsessions get stronger as a function of people performing certain behaviors.\n\nSo unlike an itch that you feel, and then you scratch\nit and it feels better, OCD is more like an itch that\nyou feel, you scratch it, and the itch intensifies.\n\nThat contour or that pattern of behaviors and thoughts interacting is very different than obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder, which mainly involves a sense\nof delayed gratification that people want and somewhat enjoy because it allows them to function better or more in line with how they would like to show up in the world.", "And then as I alluded to before, there's a reinforcement of the compulsion.\n\nIn other words, by going right, it doesn't create a situation in the brain and psychology of the person\nthat, oh, you know what, I'm not anxious anymore, left\nwould've probably been okay.\n\nIt reinforces the idea that\nright made me feel better, or turning right made me feel better, and going left would've\nbeen that much worse.\n\nAgain, it reinforces the\nobsession even further.\n\nAnd again, we could swap out\nright turns and left turns with something like hand washing, the feeling that something is contaminated and the need to wash one's hands even though one already washed their hands 20, 30, 50 times prior.\n\nAnd we're actually going\nto go back to that example a little bit later when we talk about one particular category of therapies that are very effective\nin many people for OCD which are the cognitive\nbehavioral and exposure therapies.", "The limbic system, right?\n\nThe emotion system so\nto speak inside of us always Trump's logic, right?\n\nIf you think about, does it ever make sense to\nrun into a burning building?\n\nI mean, logic says no, right?\n\nBut if someone you love is\nin the burning building, people run right in, right?\n\nBecause the limbic system says, yes.\n\nSo when logic and emotion\ncome head to head, emotion wins all the time.\n\nIf emotion is powerful enough, it will always win.\n\nAnd so the limbic system is\nso important and the limbic system does not care about the\nclock or the calendar, right?\n\nAnd that's the answer.\n\nAnd also, say why to the repetition compulsion.\n\nSo the limbic system doesn't know like, oh, it's now, it's today.\n\nIt's may, it's 2022.\n\nIt just doesn't care at all, right?\n\nSo how I would relate that\nto the repetition compulsion is when people are repeating, what they're trying to do is\nto make things right, right?\n\nWith the idea that if we\ncan repeat the situation and make it right, it will\nfix everything, right?\n\nWhich makes perfect sense if we think, well, where is that\nconcept coming from, right?\n\nIt's coming from the\nemotional part of the brain that wants relief from\nsuffering of the trauma and does not understand\nthe clock or the calendar.\n\nSo if I can solve something now, I will also solve something\nin the past, right?\n\nWhich is why I can't\ntell you how many times I've sat with someone and say, we're starting to do therapy, right?\n\nAnd a person will say, oh\ngosh, like I know, look, you just can't help me, right?\n\nI mean, you know, my last seven relationships\nhave been abusive, right?\n\nAnd I'll say back something\nsometimes like, well, if you tell me that you've\nhad seven relationships that have been abusive in different ways, I'll agree with you.\n\nLike, I only say that, 'cause that's never what\nsomeone says, right?\n\nBut I think what you're going\nto tell me is you've kind of had the same relationship seven times.\n\nIt's not seven things, it's one, right?\n\nAnd that's always, I\ndon't think one time yet that has failed to be the case.\n\nAnd that's how, so if you think about it, that's how we start to\nelucidate what's going on.\n\nSo they make the light bulb that goes off."]

Ground Truths: ['Compulsive behavior, such as addiction to video games, porn, or social media, often leads to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and dissatisfaction. Individuals may engage in these activities out of compulsion rather than enjoyment, resulting in a lack of awareness about their emotional state. They might feel terrible about their situation, similar to a gambling addict, and while they may experience brief moments of pleasure, the overall experience is described as painful and overwhelming. This compulsive engagement can prevent them from recognizing their true feelings and needs, leading to a negative impact on their emotional well-being.']

Answer: 

Several measures are being taken to protect young people from child predators on social media platforms, though there's still significant room for improvement:

1. Age restrictions: Currently, there's a legal age limit of 13 for social media use, but it's poorly enforced. There are proposals to raise this age to 16 and implement stricter age verification processes. For example, Britain is working on mandating age verification for social media platforms.

2. Parental controls: Social media platforms are providing tools for parental oversight. Parents can use these controls to monitor their children's activities and set restrictions on their social media use.

3. Content control: Social media companies have teams dedicated to controlling content and protecting young users. They focus on identifying and removing harmful content, including that related to child predators and pornography.

4. Parent-child dialogue: Experts recommend that parents have open conversations with their children about social media use. This helps parents understand their children's experiences and teach them to recognize and report inappropriate interactions, such as harassment or uncomfortable approaches from strangers.

5. Time restrictions: Limiting the total amount of time spent on social media can reduce exposure to potential risks. Some experts suggest creating "tech-free zones" during meals, before bedtime, and during family activities.

However, it's important to note that current measures are often insufficient. For instance, six out of ten adolescent girls report being approached by strangers on social media in ways that made them uncomfortable. There's a growing call for more robust safety standards, similar to those implemented for automobile safety, to protect children from exposure to harmful content and manipulative features on social media platforms.

Additionally, there's a push for greater data transparency from social media companies. Researchers and parents are calling for more access to data about the full impact of these platforms on children's mental health and safety.

While these measures are steps in the right direction, experts argue that more comprehensive and enforced regulations are needed to truly protect young people from the various risks, including child predators, on social media platforms.

Retrieved Contexts: ["but we just need a norm now for for raising the age to 16 we can struggle to do that I'm doing that with my kids I'm saying no for my daughter no Snapchat till you're 16 16 um and she's the only one who doesn't have it it's painful for her and she's 14 um but my hope is that no parent again will be in that situation that in every school a lot of the parents are going to say no no social media till 16 now of course the laws currently state that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract give away your data and make a deal with a company without your parents knowledge or permission but Congress passed this terrible law in 1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy protection act it was supposed to set the age to 16 which is not which is I think pretty reasonable but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement it's the law is written such that as long as the company doesn't absolutely know that you're underage they're fine they're not responsible 13 they're motivated the companies are now the law motivates the companies to not know how old children are there's barely any forbrain at 13 that's right that's right and since all you have to do you just have to be old enough to lie about your age if you're old enough to lie about your age you can go anywhere on the internet because there's no enforcement so I'm saying let's take the age of 13 which is not enforced let's require age verification which is complicated but they're working on that in Britain they've they're mandating that it's going to happen in Britain we'll work out the technical details um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's the one place where I think we really do need law uh because social media is a social trap and if half the kids are on it there's going to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws", "but you're trying to understand their experience is important also so you can help them understand what is not acceptable for them to experience on social media if they're being harassed or bullied by strangers uh that is a problem you want your child to to tell you about that to report that um if they see something posted online that's really concerning to them let's say they see a friend post that they're thinking of taking their own life or harming themsel in another way you want them to know that that's important to flag and to get help you know that they shouldn't just you know scroll past that so that conversation is really important and finally as parents we can lead by example right and this is hard because the truth is we've been talking about social media and youth and that's what the subject of my search and General's advisory was on but I have concerns about adults too I said as somebody who's had challenges in my own use you know of social media finding sometimes it bleeds you know past my bedtime and I'm realized you know I think m&a checked something for 5 minutes an hour later I'm still there you know scrolling through something uh and sometimes I you know you know I find myself over the years I found myself comparing myself also to posts I see online and unhealthy ways sometimes I find myself um sort of pulled into uh content uh that uh you know ends up being angry and vitriolic and leaves me feeling worse you know at the end", "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", "so I think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here too cuz Andrew my big concern with parents is look we've taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which we didn't grow up with as kids and we've told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this um you know when we were growing up you remember the motor vehicle fatalities were really high uh in America and we didn't say okay you know what that's just the price of Modern Life we just have to accept it and keep moving on with our lives we said hold on we don't have to go back to horses and Buggies but we also don't need to accept this death rate we need to make this experience safer and so we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups like Matt and others across the country that me Mothers Against Drunk Driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts airbags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that help helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents and deaths and that's what we need here too like we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting in place safety standards to protect kids from exposure to harmful content from from the experience of bullying and harassment and that also protect them from features that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use uh which is happening far too often right now we also need a policy that requires data transparency from the company you know researchers tell us all the time that they these are independent researchers they tell us they are having a hard time getting full access to the data from the social media platforms about the full impact of the platforms on the mental health of kids and as a parent look I I don't when we bought car seats for my children when when they were born we looked up the safety data like many parents we wanted to make sure the car seats were safe but if you had told me that hey you know the manufacturers of these car seats are actually not disclosing some of the the data on the impact on children uh but go ahead and buy it anyway", "There are ways that\nit can be negative, in terms of bad interactions,\nthings like bullying, which we can talk about because\nthere's a lot that we've done to basically make sure that\npeople can be safe from that and give people tools and\ngive kids the ability to have the right parental controls.\n\nTheir parents can oversee that.\n\nBut that's the interacting\nwith people side.", "so you know it's just we somehow slipped into this and once you see it that way that it's as though our kids are being raised in hara's Casino you know like like no we've got to stop this last year I had the opportunity to speak to to some of the groups at these companies that are assigned to controlling the well-being of the young people that use their platforms and the major emphasis was on the type of content so protecting them against child Predators protecting them against pornography um but as you recall at the beginning of the conversation we broke things down into variables of time specific content Dynamics and maybe the visual interface itself I think for sake of today's discussion the visual interface is probably the least interesting but I can just tell you looking things up close uh a lot not good the eyeball lengthens you become nearsighted which is why spending two hours outside um even if on a tablet has been shown to offset myopia and oh wow thousands of people children anyway there's that piece but the time piece is interesting right maybe limiting the total amount of time on social media obviously the content issue is it only takes one exposure to a video of the sort that you described The Gauntlet I never want to see it whatever has to be done to my phone so that I never see it please uh let me know", "so I would protect that time hour before bed throughout the night I would also create make sure meal times uh were Tech free zone so that people actually that you talk to one another you see one another and time with friends and family members when you're out you know at a birthday party Etc make that Tech free time let them focus on their time with other people those three Tech free zones can do a world of good uh to help your child and then the last thing I'd recommend here the many things I think parents could do is to start a dialogue with your child about their use of social media um we don't always know how social media is making our kids feel uh from the and we may realize when we talk to them that they actually have their own concerns they might say yeah it's not making me feel really good but it's just like hard not to be on it everyone's like texting on this or everyone is uh you know everyone's you know sharing information and posting pictures on it I feel like I need to be on it you can only help them start to manage that if you know that that's a challenge that they're having so opening a conversation so your child knows that you're not judging them"]

Answer: 

AG1, a nutritional supplement, is designed to support various aspects of well-being related to both mental and physical health. This comprehensive supplement provides foundational nutritional support that impacts multiple systems in the body.

For mental health, AG1 is reported to enhance:
1. Energy levels
2. Stress management (through adaptogens)
3. Overall mental well-being

In terms of physical health, AG1 supports:
1. Digestion
2. Sleep quality
3. Physical performance

AG1 achieves these benefits by providing a combination of vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and fiber. This all-in-one approach ensures that users receive a wide range of essential nutrients that contribute to optimal functioning of various bodily systems.

The supplement is described as a "nutritional insurance policy" that augments, rather than replaces, a healthy diet. By taking AG1 once or twice daily, users can cover their foundational nutritional needs, which in turn supports overall well-being.

It's important to note that while many supplements target specific outcomes, AG1 is designed to provide broad-spectrum support for multiple aspects of health. This comprehensive approach makes it a versatile supplement for those looking to improve both their mental and physical well-being.

Answer: 

Since the 1970s, anxiety and depression statistics among girls in the US have shown some notable trends:

1. Stability from the 1990s to 2010:
From the 1990s through 2010, and even into 2011, the statistics for anxiety, depression, and self-harm among girls were relatively stable. During this period, about 12-15% of girls qualified as having had a major depression. While this was higher than desired, it remained consistent.

2. Dramatic increase starting around 2012:
Around 2012, there was a sudden and significant increase in anxiety and depression rates among girls. This increase has been described as a "hockey stick" pattern, with the graph lines for girls showing a sharp upward turn. This wasn't a subtle change but a dramatic shift, as if "somebody turned on a light switch in 2012."

3. Magnitude of the increase:
The increase in depression and anxiety rates for girls since 2012 has been substantial. Most measures show increases in the range of 50% to 150%, with some nearly doubling. This is particularly pronounced for younger girls.

4. Comparison to boys:
While boys have also experienced increases in depression and anxiety, their trend differs from girls in two key ways:
   a) The increase for boys often began earlier, around 2009-2010.
   b) The boys' trend shows a more gradual, smoother increase compared to the sharp uptick seen in girls.

5. Consistency across data types:
These trends are not limited to self-reported data. Similar patterns are observed in hospital admissions for self-harm and psychiatric emergency department visits.

6. International trends:
Similar trends have been observed internationally, including in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Scandinavian countries. While the exact year may vary slightly, the pattern of a sharp increase for girls is consistent across the developed world.

It's important to note that these trends coincide with the widespread adoption of smartphones and social media, particularly among young people. While correlation doesn't imply causation, researchers have found it challenging to identify alternative explanations for this sudden and widespread change in mental health statistics among girls.

Retrieved Contexts: ["but it's nothing compared to what it is today so the lines are pretty flat until around 2012 and then all of a sudden the lines for girls go up like a hockey stick it's not a subtle thing it really is there's an elbow it's like somebody turned on a light switch in 2012 um now that's for the American data um internationally you see very similar things it's not necessarily 2012 in other countries but the girls graphs are very sharp the boys are also up on depression anxiety they're also way up depending on the measure it's usually everything is in the ballpark of 50 to 150% almost all the numbers are in that range um we're not talking 10 or 20% increases here for most things we're talking close to a doubling especially for the younger girls the boys curves interestingly are smoother that is the boys are more depressed and anxious it's but it's not 2012 it it actually often begins begins more like 2009 2010 and then it just keeps going up gradually so that that's a real clue um which we'll come back when we talk about the the boy story um it a lot of people say oh you know it's just self-report um you know just gen Z they're really they're really um positive about mental health and they're willing to talk about it's a good thing", "and we will talk about Solutions you offer some incredible Solutions in the book actually solutions that everyone listening and watching can participate in not just by restriction and we'll talk about what that means uh going forward but where are we at now and when did we start to see the trend toward diminish mental health in particular in girls yeah so feel free to hit us with the with the scary truth okay sure so let's imagine so in the US we have really good statistics based on annual or biannual surveys there's three or four big ones that allow us to see what's happened since the 70s and so what I'd like listeners to imagine is imagine a bunch of lines maybe a line for boys maybe a line a line for boys line for girls showing the percentage that suffer from anxiety depression or that have self harm those three really go together and imagine these lines they move around a little bit but they're actually pretty stable from the 1990s all the way through 2010 even 2011 there's no sign of a problem on some measures they're getting actually a little bit better because stable and low

we see the exact same curves the very sharp uptick for girls um in Hospital admissions for self harm psychiatric emergency Department visits and we see this in the US Canada Australia New Zealand uh the UK um the Scandinavian countries so something happened across the developed World um around 2012 and I keep you know Jee twangy was the first to really raise the alarm she and I keep saying well you know we can't find another candidate nothing else fits the pattern oh and there's actually not just correlational data there's experiment experimental data too", "so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "but there's this whole category of jokes like um you know when joaco was born um the doctor looked at his mother and said it's a man you know or or when jao left for college he looked at his father and said you're the man of the house now you know jokes

this two or three chess moves down the down the road um so it's very clapback sometimes in or in that case building up Joo who doesn't need any more building up but people do it anyway so things of that sort so interested in the in these um in the Nuance here because um you're telling me that girls are killing themselves more they're depressed their increase in suicide is larger boys have a much higher suicide rate so boy many more boys die from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or a bridge whereas girls tend to use pills or cutting their wrists and they and the great majority of girl suicide attempts don't lead to death yeah so are most of the issues with girls and online use social media it's sort of um uh it's despair it's at home anxious sad about self self- critiquing this kind of thing I mean you're telling me there's a a huge and I believe you that there's a tremendous increase I mean he said hockey stick like function um when we're looking at essentially capturing the tip of the p pyramid in terms of like extreme social interaction so take let me I'm not being very very clear here we have these neural circuits that evolved for social interactions that are more heightened in girls they're getting much more of it faster yeah and the consequences are no less and probably even more severe than they used to be", "Also, it's very clear that\ndepression increases over time and especially, this is surprising to me,

starts to emerge as a consequence of the\ncannabis and THC use.\n\nSo that's serious, in fact, we now know, based on really solid\nepidemiological evidence, that depression is not a strong predictor of seeking out cannabis.\n\nIt doesn't drive terribly many people to seek out cannabis use, but cannabis use, itself, makes\npeople four times likelier to develop a chronic major depression.\n\nSo anxiety is increasing,\ndepression is increasing, and this turns out to\nbe especially relevant and important to young people.\n\nWhy do I say that?\n\nWell, if you look at the data, and again, I

worse in school there's becoming more shallow there's uh conflicts with your so there's a whole bunch and then we want to look at the causal connections and what I'm trying to draw out is suppose you we suppose we could quantify the degree to which sheer time just spending five hours a day does that make you more anxious automatically well maybe a little um but that's probably not the main effect so there's a gigantic multicausal network of effects now um I have good numbers for how much the how much teenss are using these devices and these platforms today um Pew in particular did has done a great job of of tracking changes in this since the ear since the 2000s what we know today from both Pew and Gallup is that young people in America are now spending about five hours a day just on

Answer: 

Connecting people through technology has had a significant impact on knowledge productivity, with both positive and negative consequences. Historically, technological advancements that improved connectivity, such as roads, telephones, and the internet, have led to massive gains in knowledge productivity. The introduction of the internet and email revolutionized access to information and communication, making it easier and faster to share knowledge across vast distances.

However, the impact of more recent technologies, such as social media and smartphones, is more complex. On one hand, these technologies have greatly increased our ability to connect with others and access information instantly. This can lead to increased collaboration, faster dissemination of ideas, and more efficient problem-solving. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, platforms like Twitter became effective tools for rapid scientific communication, allowing researchers to share and discuss findings quickly.

On the other hand, the constant connectivity enabled by these technologies can also have drawbacks. The shift towards digital communication, especially in work settings, has led to challenges in productivity. For instance, the prevalence of video conferencing tools like Zoom during the pandemic highlighted issues with digital meetings, such as the tendency for meetings to be longer and more frequent than necessary, potentially reducing overall productivity.

Moreover, the nature of online interactions can sometimes lead to less meaningful connections compared to in-person interactions. The absence of non-verbal cues and the ease of communicating without face-to-face contact can result in miscommunication or even harmful exchanges, potentially impacting collaborative efforts and knowledge sharing.

It's important to note that the impact of technology on knowledge productivity is not uniformly positive or negative. Rather, it depends largely on how the technology is designed and used. When used thoughtfully, technology can enhance our ability to connect, collaborate, and share knowledge. However, when overused or misused, it can lead to information overload, decreased focus, and reduced quality of interactions.

In conclusion, while connecting people through technology has undoubtedly increased our potential for knowledge productivity, realizing these benefits requires a balanced and mindful approach to how we integrate these tools into our work and lives.

people in the first year of Co when we were all separated from one another you know when we finally came back together again I had so many people who said to me you know what I expected to miss my parents and my siblings and my friends not being able to see them what I didn't expect was missing the strangers that I saw at the coffee shop or the folks who I ran into the grocery store or seeing neighbors as I walked down the street like I actually missed that more than I thought I would so we have lost out on some of those interactions and those loose ties but the final thing to keep in mind also is about what is happening with how we are using social media technology which I think is fundamentally transformed how we interact with one another and how we see ourselves and each other and this is particularly true for young people uh who are growing up as digital natives but what has happened there I worry is that and and it's not that social media is all bad just to be clear you know technology look I'm I'm a believer that in technology broadly speaking you know I'm a user of technology I spent seven years building a tech company I'm a Believer in Tech", "so if you were to say the day the date the year in which everything changed would it be the day that most everyone had and has a smartphone um somewhere around 2010 2011 2012 or did all this start prior right yeah well actually if it's okay with you I'll answer that by giving sort of the the history because the short answer would be 2010 to 2015 but it'll make more sense if I just sort of go through how we got there so changes in technology when you connect people more you get roads you get telephones these things are all great um they lead to massive gains in knowledge productivity yes sometimes they're disruptions but in the history of humanity they've been great um the internet was that when you know you and I are old enough to remember do you remember the first time you saw a web browser I do and it was like you mean I just like I type in a question and I get the answer I don't have to go to the library it was I mean it was miraculous um and and I can talk to people for free and we had that by email which was free so in general Connecting People is good", "but I think whether technology helps or hurts us is about how it's designed and ultimately about how it ends up being used and what we've seen with social media as well is that uh for many people it ended up leading to in-person connections being replaced with online connections um we came to somehow value and um almost seek out more and more followers and friends on social media feeling like somehow that made us more connected but the nature of dialogue also changed like as human beings we evolved over thousands of years to not just understand the words someone is saying but to hear the tone of their voice to see their facial expression like you and I are sitting across and and we're both processing like our body language right and I'm seeing you nod your head and I'm seeing your eyes focused like all of that matters to how we communicate um but also like you and I are less likely to say something hurtful right now to one another because we can see each other if I said something to hurtful to you like i' probably see the the pain or consternation on your face and that might give me pause right when you're communicating online with other people without any of that information or with any of the uh sort of barriers if you will that make you pause before you hurt someone it leads to a very different kind of communication uh one that can be quite hurtful at times", "so so in agriculture we can have ratios um bushels of corn per whatever acres of land under cultivation and Industrial manufactur we have ratios modeles per input labor hour um so you could just measure these things uh we also had clearly defined systems of production so you could then say if I change this about the system of production what happens to this number and you could do gradient to Cent right okay I do this that number goes down let's not do that but I make this change it goes up that's a better way of building it like this was the dominant way of thinking about productivity since basically Adam Smith the knowledge work arises that doesn't work right because I'm working on whatever five different things it's different than what you are working on um how I'm managing my work is entirely ausc right in knowledge work uh organizational ideas is entirely left up to the individual how you manage your work and your workload and collaboration that's like up to you that's all off you skated there's no number to measure there's no system to improve", "MARK ZUCKERBERG: Sure.\n\nI mean, I think this is\na really important topic.\n\nThe research that we've\ndone suggests that it's not all good or all bad.\n\nI think how you're\nusing the technology has a big impact on\nwhether it is basically a positive experience for you.\n\nAnd even within technology,\neven within social media, there's not one type of\nthing that people do.\n\nI think, at its best, you're\nforming meaningful connections with other people.\n\nAnd there's a lot of research\nthat basically suggests that it's the\nrelationships that we have and the friendships that bring\nthe most happiness in our lives and, at some level,\nend up even correlating with living a longer\nand healthier life because that grounding\nthat you have in community ends up being\nimportant for that.\n\nSo I think that aspect\nof social media, which is the ability to connect\nwith people, to understand what's going on\nin people's lives, have empathy for them,\ncommunicate what's going on with your life,\nexpress that, that's generally positive.", "so I think it was a real quandry my argument is what essentially the management class came up with is p productivity which is okay in the absence of being able to be quantitative about this we will use visible activity as a proxy for useful effort so that's it like we see you doing things that's better than not the more we see you doing the better I call that pseudo productivity and I think that's implicitly how we've been organizing the management of knowledge work labor since the 1950s and when you say ability at people doing things this is the um conflating of busyness with actual productivity yes and so the problem came when we had this uh General way of measuring approximating productive effort which wasn't very good but whatever right I mean I want to see you're at the office and you're doing things the problem was the front office it Revolution right because I'm I'm essentially a techn Critic I see everything through the lens of technology in my writing we got computers we got networks we got email pseudo productivity can't be be sustainable in that context because now with something like email and then later tools like slack I can demonstrate effort at a very fine grain right because I can send an email respond to this jump onto a slack conversation I can now do that at a very fine grain level um and essentially everywhere and anywhere all throughout my day I can be demonstrating labor at home I can be demonstrating labor because we have mobile Computing we get the smartphone Revolution um so there there's now an ability to constantly be demonstrating effort at all points of our day and that's where I think the wheels came off the bus right and and led to this this this point that got worse and worse starting the early 2000s and hit ahead in the pandemic of knowledge worker burnout knowledge worker exhaustion and nihilism of like what's going on with my job like all I do is zoom all day what's happening I think that pseudo productivity plus front office it Revolution they did not play nice together and you can see this by the way if you look even at productivity books you see this huge shift that happens early 90s versus early 2000s it's like a completely shift in tone right early 90s it's stepen cvy is very optimistic it's like how are we going to self-actualize and like carefully choose the most meaningful activities to fulfill all of our dreams for all of our roles early 2000s now we have email you have David Allen that's like", "yeah are there any data um maybe from the pandemic era or um prior or Beyond about zoom and things like it in terms of how they enhance or diminish or perhaps have no effect on productivity like Zoom specifically and and meetings I we just found ourselves in Zoom all the time for a while that was bigger problem I mean so so there is data that says for example a hybrid meeting some people are online some people aren't these are less effective meetings they don't they don't work as well um but the bigger problem with zoom I think was the quantity and and part of it was just the the technology involved right so so if we're in the office together and I have a relatively quick thing to talk to you about I can just grab you and we can talk about this and then the footprint is going to be five minutes that's not just that it's five minutes it's five well allocated minutes because I'm probably going to use the social cues of your doors open or you're going to get coffee anyways right um in the zoom era instead we would say well we should set up a meeting right because you know we have to talk about this but if you think about a standard online calendar it's difficult to have a meeting that's less than 30 minutes long I mean you just you have to drag it you know", "And this is a very\ninteresting and powerful step because what it really\ncaptures at least as viewed by me,\nthe neuroscientists, is it captures a whole set\nof neural circuits about what that motivational state means\nbecause motivational states dictate a huge number of\npossible different outcomes, but they really constrain the\nnumber of different

key\nelements of creativity.\n\nAnd then the third\nelement, which is action generating techniques\nis a really cool one that you will immediately\nnotice implications for the workplace, which\nis

the reason why we're checking this all the time it's not some like individual habit deoptimization it's not oh I should just check this less often what happened is when we introduce low friction digital communication to the office this emerging consensus came about that said great let's just use ad hoc messaging as our major way of collaborating like we can just figure things out on the fly I can just be like Andrew what's going on with the whatever and you can answer me and I can send it back um this was very convenient the activation cost was low and so this is how we began actually collaborating on work now what happens is as workloads get higher we now have many things at the same time they're all generating these asynchronous back and forth conversations most of these have some sort of time sensitivity right so if I email you and say like what's going on with like the guest coming later today we have to kind of resolve this before later today um so now it's not just that these messages are going back and forth with all these different threads", "LEX FRIDMAN: Let\nthe crowd decide, and let the crowd add depth\nand breadth and context for the contribution.\n\nSo if the paper overstates\nthe degree of contribution, the crowd will\ncheck you on that.\n\nIf there's not enough support\nor the conclusions are not supported by the evidence, the\ncrowd will check you

Answer: 

Dynamic subordination plays a crucial role in enhancing team toughness within high-risk groups, particularly in elite military units like Navy SEAL teams. This concept involves a flexible hierarchy where leadership roles shift based on the specific skills required for different situations.

In high-risk environments, dynamic subordination allows teams to adapt quickly and effectively. As described by a former Navy SEAL commanding officer, this approach enables team members to take over leadership roles as different skill sets are needed. This flexibility ensures that the most competent person for a specific task is in charge, regardless of their formal rank.

The practice of dynamic subordination contributes to team toughness in several ways:

1. Adaptability: Teams can rapidly adjust to changing circumstances by allowing different members to lead based on their expertise.

2. Skill utilization: It maximizes the use of individual strengths within the team, ensuring that the best-suited person is leading at any given moment.

3. Trust building: Team members learn to trust each other's abilities and judgment, knowing that leadership will shift to the most capable person for each situation.

4. Stress distribution: By allowing leadership roles to rotate, it prevents burnout of a single leader and distributes the stress of decision-making across the team.

5. Continuous improvement: Team members are motivated to develop diverse skills to contribute effectively in various scenarios.

Importantly, this system is coupled with a culture of being "relentlessly hard on each other." This seemingly harsh approach actually serves to maintain high standards and push team members to excel. The combination of dynamic subordination and rigorous peer accountability creates an environment where team members constantly challenge and support each other, leading to increased overall toughness and effectiveness.

It's worth noting that while this concept is well-documented in military contexts, its application in other high-risk environments or different types of teams (e.g., all-female or mixed-gender groups) may vary and would require further research to fully understand.

even even if you're making a joke you have to think three steps ahead how will it be misinterpreted so a metaphor that I have in my head whenever I'm online is it's really just like being on thin ice like you can have fun on thin ice it's not all bad but you're kind of always aware that you're in danger whereas when you're hanging out with your buddies you know your good friends there's you feel totally safe and if you accidentally insult one of them you know it's like oh you know sorry you know yep you're right I'm sorry um and as followership increases the ice gets thinner yeah that's right that's right the right the higher they go the harder they fall and then a lot of people want to see want to see your fall um just want to make one point you that was interesting concept that what something in sub subordination Dynamic sub Dynamic subordination kind of like a flock of birds but is how it was described to me but you know I always thought in in the you know tier one uh Special Operations community that you know people would spend more years there Advance further and further and that's true too but but this idea that it's just understood that the hierarchy evolves in real time and the and the more um people Embrace that the better performing the group is as a pack", "Andrew Huberman: How do some\nof these same dynamics play out in non-romantic relationships?\n\nSo, for instance, in the workplace, I\nwas weaned in academic laboratories, so what's most familiar to me are, gosh,\nunfortunately, numerous examples where people working in laboratories, not the\nsame as mine, because I've been very fortunate to have amazing benevolent\nmentors, quirky and outrageous at times, but benevolent nonetheless.\n\nBut others around me have been in\nlaboratories where, for instance, the workload was just ridiculously high.\n\nLike the demand far exceeded\nwhat any person could do.\n\nAnd if somebody had, God forbid,\na cold or children, it was near impossible to impossible that they\ncould meet the standard there.\n\nOr stress dynamics, so pressure\ncooker dynamics, that made it what anyone would call a toxic environment.\n\nYou see this also in law firms.\n\nYou see it in companies.\n\nYou see it in families.\n\nYou see it in friendship circles, right?\n\nI mean, how many movies are about\nteens oppressing one another through bullying and ridicule and practical\njokes that are anything but funny, right, that are downright destructive, okay?\n\nAnd on and on.", "yeah now the word hierarchy certainly takes on a bad name especially like in our academic circles hierarchy you know is bad and power is bad bad and then subordination all these things are bad power you know inequality but I think part of what's going on there so you know I teach in a business school and there's a huge amount of writing on leadership and and I haven't read much of it but um but a key idea that I that I got I'm trying to remember the author um is that the the key puzzle is not why people want to be leaders it's why do they want to be followers we really need to study followership and so people are willing to follow because part of our amazing human ability is to work together groups to overcome obstacles we don't have sharp teeth we're not very well we're fast in long distance but not in Sprints um but we're able to work together um and when we Face a common threat we very willingly seed leadership to a leader but we have to trust him and if the leader shows that he's a narcissist that he's putting himself first that he's benefiting at our expense we don't we don't trust him so what you need to do", "ut this makes me think that during certain developmental periods rank is shaping your long lasting development I think it's a simple similar phenomenon perhaps to the older child younger child phenomenon where you know if you're the oldest you go into the world and you have lots of different roles you might be the bottom you know you're going to play on sports teams and be in different classes and have all these but the the the leadership desire slash potential skill seems to be correlated in a very non-scientific way you know the number of presidents that's often old oldest or only children this type of thing it's it's a loose correlation there's a lot of other reasons why it might not be behavioral but there's sort of you know fluffy fluffy correlations about that I think there's something to it though um when plasticity happening you're this this becomes your most familiar state of assuming a certain role and that attractor state deepens with more time spent there I find that so fascinating I've also observed and I think I've seen a few papers on I don't know how rigorous these papers are that um youngest or let's just say not oldest siblings um here we're setting aside single children that don't have any siblings but that youngest siblings uh do tend to quote unquote break the mold more in terms of uh socio and cultural norms of the family they they Venture further in terms of um experiences and systems they're often seen as having had fewer constraints than the older sibling which may or may not be true um but that the youngest uh siblings often will um take on risk yeah that older siblings won't yeah yeah yeah and that's certainly been my observation nonconformists right I mean I'm a young younger brother of an older sister um but and then but then there was times in our childhood where she was out of the house and I was at home just with my mom so so that sort of changes things but and it's very Dynamic I realize we're playing here in in a kind of a loose space but but I find Social rank stuff to be super interesting I grew up in a big pack of mostly boys um that's just kind of how it worked out in my neighborhood um at the time um and it was very interesting because it was very clear it was a dynamic hierarchy where if we were skateboarding certain kids were Alpha if we were playing soccer other kids were Alpha if we were doing anything artistic um if it was uh kind of geeky knowledge and and nerdy stuff um you know then you know might have been somebody else who had the knowledge um and had the information that people wanted so I think Dynamic hierarchies are really interesting and I think um get us out of that sort of more standard Alpha like kind of chest beating telling everyone what to do dictatorial model I mean and this is now fully out of any science land and into speculation opinion land but I think that type of structural structure where when you're doing different tasks different individuals become the the alpha or the leader because it's based on competence is very healthy", "so I think already once\nyou get to a SEAL Team, you've got people that\nare generally speaking, going to be pretty\nresilient when it comes to dealing with a loss.\n\nNot only that, I\nmean, you just get used to talk about\nlosing people, you're friends\nwith this guy, you meet this guy in SEAL\ntraining, hey, this guy seems like a stud, oh,\nhe's just going to quit.\n\nAnd you're going\nto lose five, six, seven people, eight people.\n\nPeople quit so fast you cant'\neven keep track of them.\n\nSo you're just going to lose.\n\nYou're just going\nto get used to it.\n\nSo there's that.\n\nNow once you're in\nthe Teams, what you're talking about is now you\nstart taking much more significant loss, you're\nnot losing a race, you're losing of\none of your friends.\n\nAnd this is what from a\nleadership perspective you have to pay attention to.\n\nSo when you're a leader\nin any organization, you're basically\nin charge of a mob.\n\nWhen it comes to what their\nmorale is, they're a mob, and they feed off\nof each other, just like a mob riding

can't\nget caught up with the mob.\n\nYou can't let that happen.", "And so immediately you can start to see how play starts to call into action, social dynamics in which both parties have to make some sort of agreement about how high the stakes are.\n\nNow, the failures to do this\nare also very informative in how we develop in social groups.\n\nAnd this also can inform why some people really play well with others\nand other people don't.\n\nAnd some people seem to\nget along well with groups and can handle other people.\n\nAnd some people are very rigid.", "Paul Conti: Sure.\n\nPower dynamics, of course, are very\nimportant, but also something we tend to be so over reductionist about.\n\nI mean, this idea, think about\nthat, that there's always a leader and there's always a follower.\n\nEvery single relationship, right?\n\nThat's true o n balance, we tend\nto be so reductionist, and then what we do is we miss the real\npower dynamics that are going on.\n\nJust like I had

whom and tells whom to do what.\n\nRight?\n\nBut what I learned is that so\nmuch of power dynamics are covert.\n\nThey're under the surface, for example,\nthey're the things that are not said.", "and um it's not something you find in a lot of leadership management uh literature that I that I've been exposed to so I'll take I'll take a note from from the the podcast and say if anyone knows of literature that talks about developing sustainable um ecosystems within leadership and management I would love to hear about that in the comments but um I think that's a big hole um people think about making things stable the power structure should be stable but actually being flexible and dynamic is what gives systems resilience and and flexibility um to to survive and right now all the cracks in in the towers of Academia are showing and it's time to to see if this is are we going to adapt and survive or are we going to the crumble there's a lot to unpack there and I'm grateful that you're drilling into all of that with I'm sure the same rigor and um attention to asking the really critical questions that you have in your lab um certainly I observe the landscape changing very rapidly"]

Ground Truths: ["Dynamic subordination affects team toughness in high-risk groups by allowing individuals to take over leadership roles based on their skill sets as needed, fostering a culture where team members are relentlessly hard on each other, which builds resilience and effectiveness. This constant shifting of leadership and support creates a reassuring environment where members can step up or rely on others' skills, enhancing overall team performance."]

Answer: 

Gamblers facing the fallout of their addiction experience a complex range of emotions. One of the primary emotions is shame. They feel terrible about what has happened, especially considering the impact on their families and finances. This shame is often accompanied by a deep sense of regret for the money they've spent and the damage they've caused to their lives.

Despite these negative emotions, gamblers often experience a conflicting sense of hopefulness. This hope is particularly dangerous in gambling addiction because addicts genuinely believe that the next bet could change everything. This belief leads to motivated reasoning, where the gambler convinces themselves that their luck is about to turn around, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

When not engaged in gambling, addicts often feel bad due to what's described as a "dopamine overshoot." This creates a compulsive need to return to the activity to alleviate these negative feelings. The act of gambling provides temporary relief, described as getting "back into the Zone," where they feel good for a short period.

Loneliness and anxiety are also common emotions experienced by addicts. As their addiction progresses, gamblers often isolate themselves from friends and family, leading to increased feelings of loneliness. This loneliness, coupled with the anxiety about their situation, can drive them further into the addiction as a form of self-medication.

The emotional experience of a gambling addict is particularly pernicious because, unlike other addictions, there's always the infinitesimally small yet real possibility that the next bet could indeed change everything. This unique aspect of gambling addiction makes it especially difficult for addicts to break free from the cycle, as the potential for a life-changing win is always present in their minds.

In summary, gamblers facing the fallout of their addiction experience a tumultuous mix of shame, hopefulness, loneliness, anxiety, and temporary relief, all underpinned by the persistent belief that their fortunes could change with the next bet.

Answer: 

Excessive use of digital platforms, particularly social media, has significant impacts on youth's emotions and social connections. Research indicates that adolescents are spending an average of 3.5 hours per day on social media alone, with many using it for far more time. This extensive usage is associated with several concerning effects:

1. Mental Health: Adolescents who use social media for 3 hours or more daily have double the risk of experiencing anxiety or depression symptoms. This suggests a strong correlation between excessive digital platform use and deteriorating mental health.

2. Self-esteem and Body Image: Nearly half of adolescents report that using social media has negatively affected their body image. This issue, once primarily affecting girls, is now increasingly impacting boys as well. The constant comparison to others online is eroding self-esteem among young people.

3. Sleep Disruption: About a third of adolescents stay up until midnight or later on weeknights using their devices, with much of this time spent on social media. This behavior significantly impacts sleep patterns, which are crucial for mental health and overall well-being, especially during critical developmental stages.

4. Social Connections: While digital platforms can facilitate connections, they often replace in-person interactions with online ones. This shift can lead to a decrease in the quality of relationships and a reduced ability to understand others deeply. Many young people report feeling worse about their friendships due to social media use.

5. Authenticity and Self-Expression: There's a growing concern that the pressure to create an online "brand" or persona different from one's true self is affecting young people's ability to be authentic and comfortable with who they are.

6. Vulnerability to Harmful Content: Young users are exposed to potential harassment, bullying, and inappropriate content. For instance, six out of ten adolescent girls report being approached by strangers on social media in ways that made them uncomfortable.

7. Time Displacement: Excessive use of digital platforms is cannibalizing time that could be spent on health-promoting activities like physical exercise, in-person social interactions, and sleep.

It's important to note that while there are some benefits to social media use, such as providing support and connection for marginalized groups, the overall impact of excessive use appears to be largely negative for youth's emotional well-being and social connections.

harms and then imagine all these different potential effects S one of which is depression and another is anxiety another is self harm but there's doing worse in school there's becoming more shallow there's uh conflicts with your so there's a whole bunch and then we want to look at the causal connections and what I'm trying to draw out is suppose you we suppose we could quantify the degree to which sheer time just spending five hours a day does that make you more anxious automatically well maybe a little um but that's probably not the main effect so there's a gigantic multicausal network of effects now um I have good numbers for how much the how much teenss are using these devices and these platforms today um Pew in particular did has done a great job of of tracking changes in this since the ear since the 2000s what we know today from both Pew and Gallup is that young people in America are now spending about five hours a day just on social media just social media", "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", "and I also think that one thing people many people don't recognize is that to communicate with somebody else and reach out and build a relationship with someone it actually takes a certain amount of self-esteem to do that you have to believe the other person's going to want to hang out with you they're going to see something valuable in you and for many young people what has happened uh and I think frankly for many older people too is their experience on social media has shredded their self-esteem as they constantly comparing themselves to other people like when you and I were growing up uh you know in the ' 80s we we compared ourselves to other people too right people have from Millennia but what's fundamentally different now is that in a given day you can compare yourself to thousands of images that you see online that's actually literally what people young people tell me I do roundtables with college students and high school students all the time around the country and the three things they tell me most consistently about their experience of social media is it makes them feel worse about themselves worse about their friendships but they can't get off it because the platforms are designed to maximize the amount of time they spend on them so you put all of this together and I think what has happened is that we're talking more but we understand each other less we have a lot of information but we're lacking in the wisdom that comes from Human Relationships uh and I think that that's really hurt us you know we see it certainly in the data that tells us about mental and physical health outcomes but there's also the human suffering component Andrew like it's really heartbreaking for me to travel around the country to hear hear from people of all ages often in quiet whispers about their struggles with isolation about how they feel like they just don't matter at all about how they feel like they just don't have a place where they belong and it's these are people on the outside look perfectly fine right they're posting happy things online to Folks at work they're seeming like everything's going great this is why I always tell people like you loneliness is a great masquerader it can look like withdrawal and sadness it can look like anger and irritability it can look like aloofness as well and so it's only when we stop to ask someone how they're doing when we take pause for a moment to maybe reflect on what's happening in their life that we realize that wow the majority of people in our country are actually struggling with loneliness", "but I think whether technology helps or hurts us is about how it's designed and ultimately about how it ends up being used and what we've seen with social media as well is that uh for many people it ended up leading to in-person connections being replaced with online connections um we came to somehow value and um almost seek out more and more followers and friends on social media feeling like somehow that made us more connected but the nature of dialogue also changed like as human beings we evolved over thousands of years to not just understand the words someone is saying but to hear the tone of their voice to see their facial expression like you and I are sitting across and and we're both processing like our body language right and I'm seeing you nod your head and I'm seeing your eyes focused like all of that matters to how we communicate um but also like you and I are less likely to say something hurtful right now to one another because we can see each other if I said something to hurtful to you like i' probably see the the pain or consternation on your face and that might give me pause right when you're communicating online with other people without any of that information or with any of the uh sort of barriers if you will that make you pause before you hurt someone it leads to a very different kind of communication uh one that can be quite hurtful at times", "so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "MARK ZUCKERBERG: Sure.\n\nI mean, I think this is\na really important topic.\n\nThe research that we've\ndone suggests that it's not all good or all bad.\n\nI think how you're\nusing the technology has a big impact on\nwhether it is basically a positive experience for you.\n\nAnd even within technology,\neven within social media, there's not one type of\nthing that people do.\n\nI think, at its best, you're\nforming meaningful connections with other people.\n\nAnd there's a lot of research\nthat basically suggests that it's the\nrelationships that we have and the friendships that bring\nthe most happiness in our lives and, at some level,\nend up even correlating with living a longer\nand healthier life because that grounding\nthat you have in community ends up being\nimportant for that.\n\nSo I think that aspect\nof social media, which is the ability to connect\nwith people, to understand what's going on\nin people's lives, have empathy for them,\ncommunicate what's going on with your life,\nexpress that, that's generally positive.", "but I think one thing that we have not accounted for is the cost of these changes right if we know what the costs are of certain actions we may still take those actions but we may find ways to mitigate the the costs we may in this case invest more in our relationships be more conscious about reaching out to other people going to visit at them uh but that has been a a quiet but but devastating Consequence the other piece with modernity is that we have more convenience in our life which means that we also don't need to see other people to get certain things done like buying groceries or mailing an item out or getting something from the store I can sit in the comfort of my home and have everything just come to me now on the one hand that's incredibly efficient right but I think efficiency is an interesting thing because it's only one factor we should be considering in our lives there too we have to ask the cost and one interesting thing about Co is many people in the first year of Co when we were all separated from one another you know when we finally came back together again I had so many people who said to me you know what I expected to miss my parents and my siblings and my friends not being able to see them what I didn't expect was missing the strangers that I saw at the coffee shop or the folks who I ran into the grocery store or seeing neighbors as I walked down the street like I actually missed that more than I thought I would so we have lost out on some of those interactions and those loose ties but the final thing to keep in mind also is about what is happening with how we are using social media technology which I think is fundamentally transformed how we interact with one another and how we see ourselves and each other and this is particularly true for young people uh who are growing up as digital natives but what has happened there I worry is that and and it's not that social media is all bad just to be clear you know technology look I'm I'm a believer that in technology broadly speaking you know I'm a user of technology I spent seven years building a tech company I'm a Believer in Tech", "so yes there is some evidence that overall phones and smartphones have increased risk behavior but it's more the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "so you can have two parents who are married and living in the same home and may or may not be a good relationship but living in the same home if there's no conflict or that then generally teens will do well or as you're saying there's not necessarily a direct correlation the problem comes in whether parents are living at home together or separated or divorced is if there's conflict and then that conflict tends to result in social issues emotional issues a lot of social anxiety a lot of feeling like I need to do better so that way my parents like me more and we see that with children too that's not just adolescence a lot of depression and with depression can come self-medication and uh self-medicating around other drugs and so on but that generally is resolved if the conflict resolves but as you're saying we're seeing adolescent angst regardless of parenting uh what we really need though it's not a matter of just the divorce or not divorce or the relationship between the parents it's parenting that's important so parents being good monitors being involved in their kids' lives not this oh you're 16 you have a car you can go wherever you want and we're not going to keep an eye on you we still need parents to monitor to pay attention to find out their kids' friends where are they going after school that discretionary time when parents are working and teenagers come home between 3 and 5 or 3 and six tends to be the most risky couple of hours they're it's called discretionary hours where there's no parent around and we don't always know where those teenagers are hanging out so that's more important knowing where their children are and what they're doing and that there's some adult presence some monitoring then whether or not they're still in a relationship my sense is that smartphones have allowed more communication and monitoring between parents and kids but also more interactions between kids and other kids and kids and adults more broadly so is there any evidence that uh the Advent of smartphones is directly creating problems for kids that um has to do with just so much more PE PE to peer interaction or peer to-peer exposure like when I was growing up we didn't have smartphones uh if you did something stupid like that meaning that kids would laugh at it might get told to a small group of people maybe a larger group of people but um in general it just kind of didn't go anywhere you're like a I screwed up and then You' get teased a bit and then it would kind of dissipate"]

Ground Truths: ["Excessive use of digital platforms affects youth's emotions and social connections by leading to feelings of loneliness and anxiety. While they may engage with these platforms out of compulsion, it often does not feel good to them. Many young people express awareness that much of the online content is unsatisfying, and they may feel desperate or ashamed about their compulsive use. This engagement can be likened to addiction, where the immediate gratification is fleeting and does not provide lasting satisfaction, ultimately contributing to a sense of pain rather than pleasure."]

Answer: 

COPPA, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, set the age for minors in contracts and data sharing at 13 years old. However, this age limit was not the original intention of the law. When Congress passed COPPA in 1998, it was supposed to set the age to 16, which was considered more reasonable. Unfortunately, the age was pushed down to 13 with little enforcement.

The current implementation of COPPA has several issues. The law is written in such a way that companies are not held responsible as long as they don't absolutely know that a user is underage. This motivates companies to avoid verifying users' ages, effectively allowing children to access social media platforms by simply lying about their age.

Today's views on kids' social media access are more cautious, recognizing the potential negative impacts on mental health and development. Many experts and parents are advocating for raising the age limit for social media use. For instance, Dr. Jonathan Haidt recommends delaying social media access until age 16, citing concerns about the effects on children's mental health and social development.

There are growing calls for stricter regulations and enforcement. Some proposed changes include:

1. Raising the age limit to 16 for social media access.
2. Implementing mandatory age verification systems.
3. Requiring social media companies to be more transparent about their data and the impacts of their platforms on children's mental health.

These recommendations aim to create a safer online environment for children and give parents more control over their kids' digital experiences. However, implementing these changes would require new legislation and cooperation from tech companies.

It's important to note that while COPPA set the legal age at 13, many experts now believe this is too young, especially given the rapid evolution of social media and its pervasive influence on children's lives. The disconnect between the current law and today's understanding of social media's impact on youth highlights the need for updated regulations and policies.

no no social media till 16 now of course the laws currently state that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract give away your data and make a deal with a company without your parents knowledge or permission but Congress passed this terrible law in 1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy protection act it was supposed to set the age to 16 which is not which is I think pretty reasonable but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement it's the law is written such that as long as the company doesn't absolutely know that you're underage they're fine they're not responsible 13 they're motivated the companies are now the law motivates the companies to not know how old children are there's barely any forbrain at 13 that's right that's right and since all you have to do you just have to be old enough to lie about your age if you're old enough to lie about your age you can go anywhere on the internet because there's no enforcement so I'm saying let's take the age of 13 which is not

um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's the one place where I think we really do need law uh because social media is a social trap and if half the kids are on it there's going to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws", "well not so much Facebook what if it's Tik Tok these companies these are the some of the largest and most powerful companies in the world they essentially own our children's childhood this is where childhood is taking place on a few giant PL for-profit platforms who that use an Advertising based business model so they are motivated like the Cino to keep them in don't have a clock don't let them see what time it is keep them in don't let them click over to a link to another site keep them in um we somehow have seeded our children's childhood to Giant companies that have shown that they don't really care about our kids welfare they care much more about profitability and and they care about their customers who are the advertisers and these companies have been granted a special RIT from the King Congress said in in in the in section 230 of the communications decency act in 1996 I think it was Congress said oh and nobody sue you nobody can sue you for what you show to their kids uh there was a reason for that that you don't want AOL to be responsible for everything anyone posts but it's been so broadly interpreted that so far any attempt to regulate social media or any attempt to sue them is seen as like no no", "so I think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here too cuz Andrew my big concern with parents is look we've taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which we didn't grow up with as kids and we've told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this um you know when we were growing up you remember the motor vehicle fatalities were really high uh in America and we didn't say okay you know what that's just the price of Modern Life we just have to accept it and keep moving on with our lives we said hold on we don't have to go back to horses and Buggies but we also don't need to accept this death rate we need to make this experience safer and so we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups like Matt and others across the country that me Mothers Against Drunk Driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts airbags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that help helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents and deaths and that's what we need here too like we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting in place safety standards to protect kids from exposure to harmful content from from the experience of bullying and harassment and that also protect them from features that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use uh which is happening far too often right now we also need a policy that requires data transparency from the company you know researchers tell us all the time that they these are independent researchers they tell us they are having a hard time getting full access to the data from the social media platforms about the full impact of the platforms on the mental health of kids and as a parent look I I don't when we bought car seats for my children when when they were born we looked up the safety data like many parents we wanted to make sure the car seats were safe but if you had told me that hey you know the manufacturers of these car seats are actually not disclosing some of the the data on the impact on children uh but go ahead and buy it anyway", "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", "oh these terrible devices um rather it's about a vision of childhood which is actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the reason why I got this far is because it's a set of collective action traps everyone every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone so the four recommendations I have are four ways of breaking out on the Trap but the first two are really about delaying and getting past this period of plasticity and you really help me see why it's so urgent to delay until late puberty at least so here are the four Norms that I think can break us out of this trap Norm number one uh no smartphone before high school you can give your kid a flip phone flip the Millennials had flip phones they came out fine no access or no smartphone of their own your own you can't have your own and that would even go for an iPad if you give your kid an iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it any you know anywhere in the house and you can take it outside even although maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the point is um the internet is an amazing thing and you know you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids and they can do things on the computer but you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to so it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone let them have a flip phone or a simple phone watch something like that that's rule number one rule number two is the most relevant for what we're just talking about and that is no social media until 16 there is I believe no way to make social media safe for children that is if they're going to be entering a domain in which Prestige is gained by having posts that get the most likes and followers you're making them be brand managers you're making them be performative this is not playful th", 'So,\n- Right.', "It's like-\n- Right. - Well-\n-", 'Like so-\n-', '- Yeah-\n-', 'But-\n-']

Ground Truths: ["COPPA set the age for minors in contracts and data sharing at 13. This aligns with today's views on kids' social media access as there is a push to raise the age to 16, with concerns that the current age of 13 is not enforced and allows children to easily lie about their age to access social media."]

Answer: 

Blue light exposure from smartphones, particularly during nighttime use, can have several potential negative effects on mental health:

1. Disruption of circadian rhythms: Exposure to blue light from smartphones at night can interfere with the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. This disruption can lead to sleep problems, which are closely linked to various mental health issues.

2. Suppression of dopamine release: Research has shown that light exposure to the eyes between 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM can suppress the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with mood regulation and feelings of pleasure. This suppression can potentially contribute to depressive symptoms and negatively impact overall mental well-being.

3. Activation of the "disappointment nucleus": Nighttime light exposure can activate a brain structure called the habenula, sometimes referred to as the "disappointment nucleus." This activation can lead to feelings of unhappiness and disappointment, potentially contributing to certain forms of depression.

4. Increased risk of depression and self-harm: Studies have found a strong correlation between increased nighttime light exposure and higher rates of depression. Additionally, individuals in the highest quartile of nighttime light exposure showed a significantly higher risk of self-harm compared to those with lower exposure levels.

5. Interference with mood regulation: The intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in our eyes, which respond to light, have direct connections to brain areas that control mood. Excessive nighttime light exposure can disrupt these pathways, potentially leading to mood disorders and anxiety.

6. Reduced daytime light exposure: Excessive smartphone use, especially if it leads to staying indoors more often, can result in reduced exposure to natural daylight. This lack of daytime light exposure has been associated with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders and poorer mood.

7. Social jet lag: Constant disruption of natural light-dark cycles due to smartphone use can lead to a state of "social jet lag," where our internal biological rhythms are misaligned with our social and environmental cues. This misalignment can contribute to various mental health issues.

It's important to note that while these potential negative effects are significant, they are part of a complex interplay of factors influencing mental health. Controlling light exposure, particularly by limiting bright light and blue light exposure from smartphones at night, can be an important step in supporting better mental health and overall well-being.

long-standing treatment for Seasonal effective disorder which is to give people exposure to very bright light especially in the morning the way that that's normally accomplished is with these sad lamps Seasonal effective disorder lamps and those lamps are basically bright meaning more than 10,000 Lux lights that they place on their kitchen counter or at their table in the morning or in their office so they're getting a lot of bright light that is proven to be fairly effective for the treatment of Seasonal effective disorder what's less understood is how light exposure in the middle of the night can negatively impact mood and health and so where we are headed with this is that there seems to be based on the conclusions of this new study a powerful and independent role of both daytime light exposure and nighttime dark exposure for mental health now a couple of other key points the biological mechanisms for all this are really well established there's a set of cells in the neural retina which aligns the back of your eye they're sometimes called intrinsically photosensitive retinal gangan cells they're sometimes called melanopsin retinal gangion cells we'll talk about those in a bit of detail in a moment it's well known that those cells are the ones that respond to two different types of light input not one but two different types of light input and send information to the hypothalamus where your master circadian clock resides and then your master circadian clock sends out secretory signals so peptides hormones but also neural signals to the brain and body and say hey now it's daytime now it's nighttime be awake be asleep but it goes way beyond that these melanops and intrinsically photosensitive retinal gangling cells we know also project areas of the brain like the habenula which can trigger negative affect negative mood they can trigger the release of dopamine or the suppression of dopamine the release of serot in the suppression of do of Serotonin and so they're not just cells for setting your circadian clock they also have a direct line literally one synapse away into the structures of the brain that we know powerfully control mood so so the mechanistic basis for all this is there so there's just a couple of other key points to understand for people to really be able to digest the data in this paper fully there are basically two types of stimula that these cells respond to one is very bright light as we just talked about that's why getting a lot of daytime sunlight is correlated with elevated mood that's why looking at a 10,000 Lux artificial lamp can offset Seasonal effective disorder by the way just a couple questions on that um how many Lux does the sun provide on a sunny day at noon okay great question", 'So the simple way to think about this is you want as much light\nas is safely possible early in the day, morning\nand throughout the day, including blue light, so take those blue\nblockers off during the day unless you have a real issue\nwith screen light sensitivity, and you want as little\nlight coming into your eyes, artificial or sunlight, after, say, 8:00 p.m., and certainly, you do not want to get bright light exposure to your eyes between 11:00 p.m. and\n4:00 a.m., and here\'s why, David Berson, who I mentioned before, and another and friend and\ncolleague, Samer Hattar, who\'s director of the chronobiology unit at the National Institutes\nof Mental Health published a paper in\n"Cell," which is a journal, another excellent journal,\nvery high stringency, showing that light that\narrives to the eyes between 11:00 p.m. and\n4:00 a.m., approximately, suppresses the release of dopamine, this neuromodulator\nthat makes us feel good, and it\'s sort of an\nendogenous antidepressant, and can inhibit learning and create all sorts of\nother detrimental effects, it does this through a mechanism, for those of you that wanna\nknow the neural pathways, that involves light to the eyes that\'s then signaled to a\nstructure called the habenula, the habenula looks like\ntwo little bat ears sitting right in the middle\nof a structure in your brain called the thalamus, don\'t worry about these names if you\'re not interested in this stuff, if you are, these are\njust avenues to explore, when that habenula gets activated it\'s actually called the\ndisappointment nucleus because it actually\nmakes us feel less happy and more disappointed, and can lead to certain\nforms of depression in the wakeful state.', "and then if you're getting too much light exposure will go to a different color frame this has to be possible so that you don't have to wonder if you got enough light during the day and of course if it's at the level of the eyes then you know that's what's landing at the eyes yeah and it's l i mean that's what I was going to ask you about that do these wrist based devices potentially get covered by clothing and some like turned you have your sleeves down I have my sleeves up they had it on the outside of the sleeve but they asked that people just keep it on their dominant hand it's not perfect but in some ways it's kind of nice that it's not perfect we could turn that disadvantage into an advantage by thinking you know when the person is out and about they're not often looking right at the sun you know if you're talking to a colleague under an overhang for instance so it's it's not perfect directionally it's directionally right okay and then they had two hypotheses two primary hypotheses one that greater light exposure in the day is associated with lower risk for psychiatric disorders and two second hypotheses greater light exposure at night is associated with higher risk for psychiatric disorders and poorer mood this is oh so relevant for the way we live now people on screens and tablets in the middle of the night", "my I say get them near a window and start to the best of your abilities controlling their sleep wake cycle now often times there's there you know nurses coming in and taking blood tests and measuring pulses in the middle of the night that's disruptive there there's bright light not just blue light that's disruptive it's noisy that's disruptive ICU psychosis is when non psychotic individuals start having psychotic episodes in the hospital because of nighttime light exposure and in some cases lack of daytime sunlight we can can say that with some degree of confidence because when those people go home even though sometimes their symptoms for what brought them to the hospital in the first place get worse their psychosis goes away now and it's independent of medication so let's just be really direct there is a possibility that we are all socially jetlagged that we are all disrupting these mood regulation symptoms systems excuse me by not getting enough daytime light and by getting too much nighttime light if we want to look at just some of the bullet points of the takeaways and then Peter thank you you highlighted a few of these but can we just go back to this figure two for a second there's a handful of things that really was going to want to want to dig in the DAT just um and and again I normally wouldn't make so much hay out of this except for the fact that they're so tight um but the there are a few that really stand out um and again I love this figure um I would have labeled it a little differently to make it completely userfriendly but nevertheless the increasing light at night and the impact on depression let let me be really technical in what I say and the relationship or correlation to depression is very strong um the relationship to light and self harm in the upper cortile so when you take those 25% of people with the most nighttime light that relationship to self harm is interesting and completely uncoupled from the other 75% that's interesting but uncoupled you mean that at the lower levels of light exposure at night you're not seeing an increase in self harm not what and then once you get to that fourth quartile it's a big step it's like a 30% greater risk of self yeah so it's totally flat the first second third quartile no different"]

Answer: 

Unaccompanied children playing outside without adult supervision face several challenges in today's society:

1. Legal and social risks: In some areas, allowing children to play unsupervised can be interpreted as child neglect. There have been instances where concerned neighbors or passersby have called the police upon seeing unaccompanied children, leading to potential involvement of child protective services. This can result in serious consequences for families, including custody battles and increased supervision.

2. Lack of social acceptance: Since the 1990s, it has become increasingly uncommon to see children playing outside alone. This shift in social norms has made unsupervised play less accepted and more likely to raise concerns among community members.

3. Reduced opportunities for unstructured play: With the rise of structured activities and increased screen time, children have fewer opportunities for free, unstructured play outdoors. This limits their ability to develop important social skills, problem-solving abilities, and independence.

4. Overprotection and fear: Societal fears about child abduction and safety, although often disproportionate to actual risks, have led to increased parental supervision and reduced freedom for children to explore and play independently.

5. Loss of social capital: Changes in community dynamics, such as decreased trust among neighbors and smaller family sizes, have contributed to a reduction in the support network that once allowed children to play freely in their neighborhoods.

6. Competition with digital entertainment: The prevalence of smartphones, social media, and video games provides strong competition for outdoor play, making it more challenging for children to engage in traditional forms of unstructured play.

These challenges have significant implications for children's development, as unstructured play is crucial for learning social skills, negotiation, conflict resolution, and developing independence. Efforts are being made to address some of these issues, such as passing laws in some states to protect parents who allow their children to play independently, and initiatives to promote outdoor play and reduce excessive screen time.

video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at

us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate

guys go have fun like I'm not going to be with you you know you know yeah there's a chance you'll get kidnapped or struck by lightning although lightning is more likely um so and then it you know and

about child abduction and child sexual abuse um some of the scandals were real the Boy Scouts the Catholic Church there were cases where trusted organizations were covering up abuse and I recall the

was Brian he would just remind himself every night about his real name you know I think they found him eventually in Berkeley mhm not calling out Berkeley I lived in Berkeley for a long time but um seemed to be the discovery of of Abu of abducted kid excuse me in Berkeley uh there are a few other cases there I don't know what that's about um in any of I grew up thinking that you could get kidnapped right yeah which yeah which is so it's I mean it's the most terrifying possibility for any parent um but when I was doing the research for the codling the American mind I found according to FBI statistics there's only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings a year in our whole country because if a child like who would take a child like it's a really difficult crime and you're going to you know who would steal a child from a store you know parents are afraid if your kid goes to the next D on the grocery store going to be how are you going to take a kicking and screaming kid out of a store um it's and yet sorry to interrupt but the show America's Most Wanted I believe was hosted by a guy whose kid was abducted and eventually found dead exactly Adam that's right right so so there was this propagation of this fear like that one of the deepest fears of any parent I can to imagine is is is that that's right but the point is that these crimes are extraordinarily rare it's almost always the non-custodial parent who takes a kid it's a family member because there's a fight within the family um so we fear the wrong things we're terrified of kidnapping um but locking our kids up overprotecting them has spiked the suicide rate so much that the death toll is vastly higher from the extra suicides than it would be if we could completely wipe out kidnapping which again doesn't"]

Answer: 

Watching dismemberment videos can have severe negative impacts on young people's mental health. Exposure to such extreme violent content at a young age can be deeply traumatizing and lead to long-lasting psychological effects.

Dr. Jonathan Haidt discusses how young people often regret seeing disturbing content online at an early age. He mentions "the gauntlet," a series of increasingly graphic videos culminating in scenes of extreme violence like dismemberment. Haidt emphasizes that these images can become permanently etched in a person's mind, occupying "neural real estate" that can't be easily cleared.

Trauma is defined as an adverse event that permanently alters brain function in ways that reduce effectiveness in life. Exposure to graphic violence, even through video, can potentially cause this type of trauma, especially in young, developing brains. This aligns with Dr. Paul Conti's explanation that vicarious experiences, including viewing disturbing content, can lead to brain changes similar to directly experienced trauma.

The potential effects on young people's mental health may include:

1. Increased anxiety and hypervigilance
2. Development of defensive behaviors
3. Feelings of shame and guilt
4. Difficulty forming healthy relationships later in life
5. Potential for dissociation as a coping mechanism

It's important to note that even brief exposure to such content can be harmful. As Haidt mentions, sometimes just seconds of viewing extremely disturbing material can have lasting impacts.

Additionally, the context suggests that repeated exposure to violent or disturbing content through social media and news can have cumulative negative effects on mental health, potentially leading to depression, anxiety, and other psychological issues.

While the provided information doesn't specifically focus on dismemberment videos, the general principles discussed about exposure to extreme violence and disturbing content apply. More targeted research would be needed to fully understand the specific effects of dismemberment videos on young people's mental health.

from other kids and um the stress that was on everybody um stress generally the sociopolitical landscape social media I mean it's hard to not feel like it's at least a cloudier maybe a darker time

there's still some optimists out there so absolutely uh there there plenty of studies that show the bidirectional relationship between anxiety depression Mental Health and substance use you're right a lot of teens are self-medicating by using various substances to reduce their anxiety reduce their stress and also just social lubrication right of going into a party and and pregaming or going into a party and using drugs to make themselves uh less stiff less less stressed during that situation but more what we're talking about is that they're self-medicating because they're feeling sad or uncomfortable and this is they think helping them again it's not helping it's making them feel less bad had by continuing to use", "so you know it's just we somehow slipped into this and once you see

nearsighted which is why spending two hours outside um even if on a tablet has been shown to offset myopia and oh wow thousands of people children anyway there's that piece but the time piece is

Answer: 

Since the 1990s, there has been a significant trend toward diminished mental health in girls, particularly noticeable from around 2012. Prior to 2012, mental health indicators for girls were relatively stable, with about 12-15% qualifying as having had a major depression. However, around 2012, there was a dramatic change.

The data shows a sharp uptick in mental health issues for girls, often described as a "hockey stick" pattern on graphs. This sudden increase was not subtle; it was as if someone had "turned on a light switch" in 2012. The rise in mental health issues for girls has been substantial, with increases ranging from 50% to 150% depending on the measure. This means that for many indicators, there has been close to a doubling of mental health problems among girls.

This trend is not limited to self-reported data. Similar patterns have been observed in hospital admissions for self-harm and psychiatric emergency department visits. Importantly, this phenomenon is not isolated to a single country. The same sharp uptick for girls has been observed across the developed world, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavian countries.

While boys have also experienced increases in depression and anxiety, their trend line is generally smoother and began slightly earlier, around 2009-2010. The contrast between the sharp increase for girls and the more gradual increase for boys is considered a significant clue in understanding the phenomenon.

The context suggests that the widespread adoption of smartphones and social media may be a potential cause for this trend. The timing of the uptick coincides with the proliferation of these technologies, and no other explanatory factor that fits the pattern has been identified. Additionally, there is mention of experimental data supporting this connection, although specific details are not provided in the given context.

It's worth noting that while this trend is alarming, the information provided does not give a complete picture of the current state or any potential improvements since 2012. Further research would be needed to understand the full scope and current status of this mental health trend among girls.

Ground Truths: ['Since the 1990s, the percentage of girls suffering from anxiety, depression, or self-harm has been relatively stable, with no significant signs of a problem observed until around 2010 or 2011. In fact, some measures indicated that the situation was getting a little bit better during this period, although the rates of major depression among girls were still concerning, with around 12-15% qualifying as having had a major depression.']

Answer: 

From a neurobiological perspective, the issues related to boys and their mental health are closely tied to the neural circuits associated with sex and violence. These circuits have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years and are particularly heightened in boys.

In the modern context of smartphones and social media, these neural circuits are being stimulated in unprecedented ways. The content boys are exposed to, particularly related to violence and sex, is more intense and readily available than ever before. For example, violent video games and easily accessible pornography provide a "super stimulus" for these circuits, similar to how junk food overstimulates our reward systems.

The neurobiologist's view highlights that these stimuli are capturing the extremes of neural circuit functions in boys. This leads to faster, more potent interactions with potentially more severe consequences. The rapid and intense stimulation of these circuits can potentially lead to addiction-like behaviors and difficulties in regulating emotions and impulses.

Interestingly, while girls also face significant mental health challenges related to social media use, the neurobiological perspective suggests that the underlying mechanisms differ. Girls' neural circuits appear to be more attuned to social interactions and self-image, which are heavily impacted by social media platforms.

It's important to note that hormones play a crucial role in brain development and behavior. The context mentions how testosterone, typically associated with male development, is actually converted to estrogen in the brain, which then has organizing effects on brain structure. This complex interplay of hormones contributes to sex differences in brain development and behavior.

The neurobiological perspective also emphasizes the impact of constant smartphone use on sleep patterns and visual processing. The habit of looking at screens 8-12 inches away for extended periods is a significant departure from how our visual systems evolved, potentially contributing to stress and altered cognitive functioning.

In conclusion, a neurobiologist would likely emphasize that boys' mental health issues are deeply rooted in the interaction between evolutionarily old neural circuits and modern technological stimuli. This perspective highlights the need for interventions that consider these biological factors alongside social and psychological approaches.

know you knock it it's amazing it's thrilling um that does seem to be a sex difference now girls I think now here I'm speculating but girls seem to be more interested in having an effect in the social

Answer: 

Several measures are being taken to protect young people from child predators on social media platforms, though there's still significant room for improvement:

1. Age restrictions: Currently, there's a legal age limit of 13 for social media use, but it's poorly enforced. There are proposals to raise this age to 16 and implement stricter age verification processes. For example, Britain is working on mandating age verification for social media platforms.

2. Parental controls: Social media platforms are providing tools for parental oversight. Parents can use these controls to monitor their children's activities and set restrictions on their social media use.

3. Content control: Social media companies have teams dedicated to controlling content and protecting young users. They focus on identifying and removing harmful content, including that related to child predators and pornography.

4. Parent-child dialogue: Experts recommend that parents have open conversations with their children about social media use. This helps parents understand their children's experiences and teach them to recognize and report inappropriate interactions, such as harassment or uncomfortable approaches from strangers.

5. Time restrictions: Limiting the total amount of time spent on social media can reduce exposure to potential risks. Some experts suggest creating "tech-free zones" during meals, before bedtime, and during family activities.

However, it's important to note that current measures are often insufficient. For instance, six out of ten adolescent girls report being approached by strangers on social media in ways that made them uncomfortable. There's a growing call for more robust safety standards, similar to those implemented for automobile safety, to protect children from exposure to harmful content and manipulative features on social media platforms.

Additionally, there's a push for greater data transparency from social media companies. Researchers and parents are calling for more access to data about the full impact of these platforms on children's mental health and safety.

While these measures are steps in the right direction, experts argue that more comprehensive and enforced regulations are needed to truly protect young people from the various risks, including child predators, on social media platforms.

and she's the only one who doesn't have it it's painful for her and she's 14 um but my hope is that no parent again will be in that situation that in every school a lot of the parents are going to say no no social media till 16 now of course the laws currently state that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract give away your data and make a deal with a company without your parents knowledge or permission but Congress passed this terrible law in 1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy protection act it was supposed to set the age to 16 which is not which is I think pretty reasonable but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement it's the law is written such that as long as the company doesn't absolutely know that you're underage they're fine they're not responsible 13 they're motivated the companies are now the law motivates the companies to not know how old children are there's barely any forbrain at 13 that's right that's right and since all you have to do you just have to be old enough to lie about your age if you're old enough to lie about your age you can go anywhere on the internet because there's no enforcement so I'm saying let's take the age of 13 which is not enforced let's require age verification which is complicated but they're working on that in Britain they've they're mandating that it's going to happen in Britain we'll work out the technical details um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's the one place where I think we really do need law uh because social media is a social trap and if half the kids are on it there's going to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws", "but you're trying to understand their experience is important also so you can help them understand what is not acceptable for them to experience on social media if they're being harassed or bullied by strangers uh that is a problem you want your child to to tell you about that to report that um if they see something posted online that's really concerning to them let's say they see a friend post that they're thinking of taking their own life or harming themsel in another way you want them to know that that's important to flag and to get help you know that they shouldn't just you know scroll past that so that conversation is really important and finally as parents we can lead by example right and this is hard because the truth is we've been talking about social media and youth and that's what the subject of my search and General's advisory was on but I have concerns about adults too I said as somebody who's had challenges in my own use you know of social media finding sometimes it bleeds you know past my bedtime and I'm realized you know I think m&a checked something for 5 minutes an hour later I'm still there you know scrolling through something uh and sometimes I you know you know I find myself over the years I found myself comparing myself also to posts I see online and unhealthy ways sometimes I find myself um sort of pulled into uh content uh that uh you know ends up being angry and vitriolic and leaves me feeling worse you know at the end", "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", "so I think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here too cuz Andrew my big concern with parents is look we've taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which we didn't grow up with as kids and we've told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this um you know when we were growing up you remember the motor vehicle fatalities were really high uh in America and we didn't say okay you know what that's just the price of Modern Life we just have to accept it and keep moving on with our lives we said hold on we don't have to go back to horses and Buggies but we also don't need to accept this death rate we need to make this experience safer and so we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups like Matt and others across the country that me Mothers Against Drunk Driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts airbags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that help helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents and deaths and that's what we need here too like we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting in place safety standards to protect kids from exposure to harmful content from from the experience of bullying and harassment and that also protect them from features that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use uh which is happening far too often right now we also need a policy that requires data transparency from the company you know researchers tell us all the time that they these are independent researchers they tell us they are having a hard time getting full access to the data from the social media platforms about the full impact of the platforms on the mental health of kids and as a parent look I I don't when we bought car seats for my children when when they were born we looked up the safety data like many parents we wanted to make sure the car seats were safe but if you had told me that hey you know the manufacturers of these car seats are actually not disclosing some of the the data on the impact on children uh but go ahead and buy it anyway", "There are ways that\nit can be negative, in terms of bad interactions,\nthings like bullying, which we can talk about because\nthere's a lot that we've done to basically make sure that\npeople can be safe from that and give people tools and\ngive kids the ability to have the right parental

Answer: 

Several strategies can help reduce youth exposure to harmful online content:

1. Implementing robust parental controls: Social media platforms should provide tools that allow parents to oversee their children's online activities and set appropriate restrictions.

2. Raising the age limit for social media use: Some experts suggest increasing the minimum age for social media use to 16, with proper age verification systems in place. This could help protect younger, more vulnerable children from harmful content.

3. Creating tech-free zones and times: Establishing periods and areas where device use is prohibited, such as during meals, before bedtime, and during family activities, can reduce overall exposure and promote healthier habits.

4. Fostering open dialogue: Parents should engage in ongoing conversations with their children about their online experiences, helping them understand what is and isn't acceptable, and encouraging them to report concerning content or interactions.

5. Educating youth about online risks: Teaching children to recognize and respond appropriately to harmful content, bullying, or harassment is crucial for their online safety.

6. Implementing safety standards: Government policies could mandate safety standards for social media platforms, similar to how safety features were introduced in the automotive industry to reduce accidents.

7. Improving data transparency: Requiring social media companies to share comprehensive data about their platforms' impact on youth mental health would allow for better research and informed decision-making by parents and policymakers.

8. Providing user-friendly tools: Social media platforms should offer features that help users, especially teens, manage their time online and diversify the content they consume, reducing the risk of harmful exposure.

By combining these strategies, we can create a safer online environment for youth while still allowing them to benefit from the positive aspects of social media and digital connectivity.

daughter no Snapchat till you're 16 16 um and she's the only one who doesn't have it it's painful for her and she's 14 um but my hope is that no parent again will be in that situation that in every school a lot of the parents are going to say no no social media till 16 now of course the laws currently state that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract give away your data and make a deal with a company without your parents knowledge or permission but Congress passed this terrible law in 1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy protection act it was supposed to set the age to 16 which is not which is I think pretty reasonable but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement it's the law is written such that as long as the company doesn't absolutely know that you're underage they're fine they're not responsible 13 they're motivated the companies are now the law motivates the companies to not know how old children are there's barely any forbrain at 13 that's right that's right and since all you have to do you just have to be old enough to lie about your age if you're old enough to lie about your age you can go anywhere on the internet because there's no enforcement so I'm saying let's take the age of 13 which is not enforced let's require age verification which is complicated but they're working on that in Britain they've they're mandating that it's going to happen in Britain we'll work out the technical details um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's the one place where I think we really do need law uh because social media is a social trap and if half the kids are on it there's going to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws", "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", "so I think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here too cuz Andrew my big concern with parents is look we've taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which we didn't grow up with as kids and we've told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this um you know when we were growing up you remember the motor vehicle fatalities were really high uh in America and we didn't say okay you know what that's just the price of Modern Life we just have to accept it and keep moving on with our lives we said hold on we don't have to go back to horses and Buggies but we also don't need to accept this death rate we need to make this experience safer and so we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups like Matt and others across the country that me Mothers Against Drunk Driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts airbags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that help helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents and deaths and that's what we need here too like we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting in place safety standards to protect kids from exposure to harmful content from from the experience of bullying and harassment and that also protect them from features that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use uh which is happening far too often right now we also need a policy that requires data transparency from the company you know researchers tell us all the time that they these are independent researchers they tell us they are having a hard time getting full access to the data from the social media platforms about the full impact of the platforms on the mental health of kids and as a parent look I I don't when we bought car seats for my children when when they were born we looked up the safety data like many parents we wanted to make sure the car seats were safe but if you had told me that hey you know the manufacturers of these car seats are actually not disclosing some of the the data on the impact on children uh but go ahead and buy it anyway", "So we work hard on all these\ndifferent problems-- making sure that we're helping connect\npeople as best as possible, helping make sure that\nwe give people good tools to block people who\nmight be bullying them, or harass them, or\nespecially for younger folks, anyone under the age of 16\ndefaults into an experience where their\nexperience is private.\n\nWe have all these\nparental tools.\n\nSo that way, parents can\nunderstand what their children are up to in a good balance.\n\nAnd then on the\nother side, we try to give people tools\nto understand how they're spending their time.\n\nWe try to give people tools\nso that if you're a teen and you're stuck in some\nloop of just looking at one type of content,\nwe'll nudge you and say, hey, you've been looking at content\nof this type for a while.\n\nHow about something else?\n\nAnd here's a bunch\nof other examples.\n\nSo I think that there\nare things that you can do to push this in\na positive direction.\n\nBut I think it just\nstarts with having a more nuanced view of this\nisn't all good or all bad.\n\nAnd the more that you\ncan make it a positive thing, the better this\nwill be for all the people who use our products."]

Answer: 

Increased smartphone use has several significant effects on sleep, blue light exposure, and activity levels:

1. Sleep: 
Smartphone use, especially late at night, can disrupt sleep patterns. The bright light exposure from screens in the middle of the night triggers neuronal activation, which can interfere with the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. This is particularly problematic because our retinal sensitivity increases late in the day, making us more susceptible to the effects of light at night.

2. Blue light exposure:
Smartphones emit blue light, which can be especially disruptive when viewed close to bedtime. This additional blue light exposure can affect our circadian rhythms and melatonin production, potentially leading to sleep disturbances and other health issues. Even dimming the screen may not be sufficient to counteract these effects entirely.

3. Activity levels:
Increased smartphone use is associated with more sedentary behavior and less time spent in nature or engaging in physical activities. This reduction in activity can have negative impacts on overall health and well-being.

Beyond these direct effects, excessive smartphone use can have broader implications:

4. Attention and focus:
Studies have shown that excessive smartphone use can lead to difficulties in attention and focus. One study of 7,102 adolescents found that using smartphones for more than 60 minutes per day led to significant issues with attention. For adults, the threshold may be slightly higher, possibly around two hours per day.

5. Mental health:
There's a correlation between increased smartphone use, particularly among young girls, and a rise in depression rates. The constant stimulation and lack of "solitude" (defined as absence of stimuli created by other human minds) can lead to brain exhaustion and increased anxiety.

6. Hormonal effects:
Some data suggests that smartphone use may have effects on hormones, potentially contributing to decreases in testosterone levels and sperm counts. However, this connection is not fully established and requires further research.

To mitigate these effects, experts recommend limiting smartphone use, especially before bedtime. Avoiding bright light exposure at night and controlling light exposure behaviors can support better mood, mental health, learning, focus, and metabolism.

It's important to note that while smartphones offer many benefits, being mindful of usage patterns and implementing strategies to reduce negative impacts can help maintain better overall health and well-being.

one of the other negative effects right so we have the positive effects you talked about which is consolidation of learning and acceleration of learning we had the one negative effect which was the pavlovian connection to distraction the other I've written about before is Solitude deprivation right so so I'm using a different definition of solitude than the colloquial one most people think of it as a physical thing I'm I'm just isolated but there's a there's a cognitive psychological definition of solitude which means absence of stimuli created by other human Minds right so I'm not taking in information that's coming directly from another human mind uh having no period with this Solitude so having no period in your day where your free from stimuli creative from other Minds is Solitude deprivation and it's a real issue and partially it's a real issue because when we're processing input from another human brain it's all hands- on Deck right I mean we're very social beings a huge portion of our brain is dedicated to this right um so it's a very cognitively expensive activity when I'm trying to understand another human's what they're saying I'm simulating their mental state I'm trying to understand like where do they fall in this sort of social hierarchy and one of my arguments was um when you spend your entire day in that state it's exhausting and anxiety producing and like until we had smartphones and ubiquitous wireless internet the idea that you could banish all Solitude from your day is laughable it's just impossible right so of course we had a lot of portions of our day where our brain was not like ramped up in gear four like the sort of social processing mode but smartphones makes it possible that you can be in that mode all day long and so like one of the things I hypothesize is some of the anxiety Rises that goes with the age of smartphones is brain exhaustion right so that's like that's another negative effect of the const we have two negative effects now for the constant stimuli and one positive effect for the absence of the constant stimula so I think we're making a case here for not always being on your device"]

Answer: 

Outdoor play and independence in childhood have significantly different effects on kids today compared to the era before widespread smartphone reliance. In the past, children experienced a play-based childhood that was crucial for healthy human development. They were often encouraged to play outside, explore their neighborhoods, and engage in independent activities.

This type of childhood provided several benefits:

1. Social development: Children learned to negotiate situations with other kids, resolve conflicts, and collaborate through unstructured playtime.

2. Physical activity: Being outdoors encouraged more movement and exercise.

3. Independence: Kids had the opportunity to have adventures, make decisions, and learn to be self-supervised.

4. Memory formation: Real-world experiences created lasting memories and stories to share.

5. Connection with nature: Outdoor play allowed children to interact with the natural environment.

In contrast, today's smartphone-reliant childhood has led to several concerning trends:

1. Reduced outdoor time: Children spend an average of 7-10 hours a day on screens, including social media, video games, and other smartphone activities.

2. Less independence: Parents are less likely to let children play unsupervised outdoors due to safety concerns and the prevalence of indoor entertainment options.

3. Addiction-like behaviors: Short-form video content on platforms like TikTok and YouTube is particularly addictive due to quick reinforcement.

4. Mental health impacts: There's a correlation between increased smartphone use and declining mental health among young people.

5. Reduced real-world experiences: Virtual adventures are replacing physical ones, potentially limiting the development of important life skills.

The shift from a play-based to a phone-based childhood has raised concerns among experts about its compatibility with healthy human development. However, there's growing awareness of these issues, and some parents are starting to reintroduce outdoor play and independence in their children's lives.

To address these challenges, experts suggest:

1. Delaying smartphone ownership until high school
2. Prohibiting social media use until age 16
3. Implementing phone-free schools
4. Encouraging more independence, free play, and responsibility in the real world

By reintroducing elements of a play-based childhood, we may be able to mitigate some of the negative effects of smartphone reliance and provide children with the benefits of outdoor play and independence that were more common in previous generations.

marginally social media it's more of an general information Source but the point is especially the short videos the short videos are really really addictive because the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the house every day to go play my mom would say get out of the house I now realize she wanted space yeah", "um so I am I'm very very confident that childhood is going to look very different within two years I don't mean that it won't be seven-year-olds on phones but in the same way that we flipped on smoking we used to think it was okay to smoke in an airplane uh we used to think it was okay to smoke in restaurants it was okay to smoke everywhere we thought um and now we don't we don't think that anymore that took a long time to change but it did change I think because of the public disgust with seeing children just spending their childhood looking at a screen and because the public disgust with what we've heard about meta and and Tik Tok and a few of the other companies um I think within two years it's going to be widespread it'll be a norm that you just don't give kids social media in particular I mean iPads are complicated because you know you want kids you know to watch movies is okay stories are good I'm not saying the you know iPad is a terrible thing but um our attitudes about this are going to change radically um and I think the great majority of schools are going to be phone free within two years um and we're going to see we're already seeing more kids outside lot every day I get I get emails from Greatful parents saying you know because of your book me know my six-year-old he wanted to ride his bicycle down to the end of our cesac he wanted to ride down Circle and come back and I never would let him because I was afraid that what what would the neighbors say but once I read your book I decided to let him and he was so ecstatic he kept doing it and doing it and now he's going further and he rides to his friends houses so people in her neighborhood now they're seeing a kid on a bicycle and if Suppose there were 10 kids doing it well now it's normal so we can renormalize human childhood in the real world where our kids get the chance to have independent adventures and learn how to be self-supervised adults ultimately we can do this okay", "I mean it's crazy what happens so eight states have now said no no more of that this is insane um so we so law could help to put to to stop incentivizing helicopter parenting to provide uh uh more spaces that are safe for kids to play in not car zones um so the book has the exas generation the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "so that's the third Norm is uh no uh is phonefree schools you have to lock up the phone in the morning either a lock in a phone lock or Yonder pouch um if the policy is you keep in your pocket that's not a policy that's just a recipe for constant conflict with the kids because they can't help it they have to text if anyone's texting they have to be texting and the fourth Norm is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real world because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing we have to do is restore a really fun adventurous childhood like you know what you were saying you know you go out on your bicycle you're hanging out with your friends friends sometimes something happens and boy you have memories I mean exciting things happen scary things happen you have memories and you know I worry about like what you know what boys today you know I have a group of Buddy my group of friends that I you know we we still talk about things that happened you know things that amazing things that happened when we were in college or after college and I wonder what boys young boys today are going to say you know you remember fortnite game 27363 where you

Independence and Adventure uh where they work out the conflicts themselves", "oh these terrible devices um rather it's about a vision of childhood which is actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the reason why I got this far is because it's a set of collective action traps everyone every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone so the four recommendations I have are four ways of breaking out on the Trap but the first two are really about delaying and getting past this period of plasticity and you really help me see why it's so urgent to delay until late puberty at least so here are the four Norms that I think can break us out of this trap Norm number one uh no smartphone before high school you can give your kid a flip phone flip the Millennials had flip phones they came out fine no access or no smartphone of their own your own you can't have your own and that would even go for an iPad if you give your kid an iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it any you know anywhere in the house and you can take it outside even although maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the point is um the internet is an amazing thing and you know you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids and they can do things on the computer but you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to so it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone let them have a flip phone or a simple phone watch something like that that's rule number one rule number two is the most relevant for what we're just talking about and that is no social media until 16 there is I believe no way to make social media safe for children that is if they're going to be entering a domain in which Prestige is gained by having posts that get the most likes and followers you're making them be brand managers you're making them be performative this is not playful th", "whatever but um but kids need to be out playing with each other especially Outdoors we evolved in savanas we evolved in different parts of the world we're attracted to Nature um so that's the way it it always was now uh especially if we in the 1950s and 60s America just been through a World War and the greatest way to make people trust each other the greatest way to boost social capital is a foreign attack and of course Pearl Harbor did more for American Co coherence than anything else in history in modern history 911 did that too but only for a little while and then we we lost it um so for a a lot of reasons people trusted their neighbors kids were out playing you know my parents grew up in the depression in New York City the kids were all out playing stickball on the street or in a parking lot in the 1970s there is a real crime wave um crime goes through the roof actually and it goes through the 80s that goes all the way to the early 90s even still you were kicked out of the house to go play um even in New York City all kids went out to play that's just the way it was but we begin to lose trust in each other for a lot of reasons Robert putam wrote about this in Bowling alone the the the the loss of Social Capital many reasons for that the changing media environment air conditioning and television people are not hanging out on their porch in the summertime to get away from the Heat they Clos the door and they put on the AC and they watch TV family sizes are shrinking there are not that many kids around so for a lot of reasons by the the 90s is the key decade where act two of the tragedy happens and that's the loss of the play-based childhood", "I love what your mom did getting you guys outside um my parents did the same thing too like we I was very blessed to have two parents who didn't come you know they didn't have a lot of resources growing up they didn't come to this country with a lot of resources but the one of the greatest gifts they G gave us is that they loved us uncondition Al the other great gift that they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out", "look you guys actually you can see what this is doing to you you mostly agree that this is wasting your time it's garbage you you want to way out but you just feel like you can't there's such resignation um but look the cool kids over there they have flip phones and they're out like every day after school they're like you know they're doing stuff they're down at you know they're in the mall they're they're getting pizza they're you know building a fort uh you know whatever depending on the age um so I think the way out is to give kids an exciting childhood kids are so lonely now and and they they don't have much in the way of Adventure they don't have much in the way of Thrills um you know you know I live I live in New York City um you know I would start I would like bring my kids out to Coney Island when they were you know 9 10 years old bring them out and then I would just say I'm just going to sit here you guys run around you guys go have fun like I'm not going to be with you you know you know yeah there's a chance you'll get kidnapped or struck by lightning although lightning is more likely um so and then it you know and then it got once they were you know in more you know like like 13 now they can actually take the subway out to Coney Island with a friend so um that's cool"]

Ground Truths: ["Outdoor play and independence in childhood are essential for creating memorable and adventurous experiences for kids today, contrasting sharply with the reliance on smartphones. The speaker emphasizes that children need real adventures and independence to work out conflicts themselves, rather than being absorbed in virtual experiences. The concern is that today's children may lack the rich, exciting memories that come from outdoor play, as they are often preoccupied with their devices, which do not provide the same depth of experience."]

Answer: 

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed in 1998 and set the age for minors in contracts and data sharing at 13 years old. However, this age was not the original intention of the law. Initially, COPPA was supposed to set the age at 16, which was considered more reasonable. The age was pushed down to 13 during the legislative process, and the law was implemented with minimal enforcement.

This 13-year-old threshold doesn't align well with today's views on kids' social media access. Many experts and parents now believe that 13 is too young for unrestricted social media use. For instance, Dr. Jonathan Haidt recommends delaying social media access until age 16. He argues that there's "barely any forebrain at 13," suggesting that children at this age are not developmentally ready for the challenges posed by social media.

Current views on kids' social media access tend to favor a higher age limit. This is due to growing concerns about the impact of social media on mental health, sleep patterns, and overall well-being of young people. For example, research shows that adolescents who use social media for 3 hours or more per day have double the risk of experiencing anxiety or depression symptoms.

There's a growing movement to raise the age of social media access to 16, which would better align with the original intent of COPPA. This push is supported by evidence of the negative impacts of social media on younger teens and the recognition that children need more time to develop the cognitive and emotional skills to navigate the complexities of online social interactions.

In summary, while COPPA set the age at 13 for online contracts and data sharing, this no longer aligns with current views on appropriate social media access for minors. Today's perspective leans towards delaying social media use until at least 16, reflecting a better understanding of adolescent development and the potential risks associated with early social media exposure.

to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws", "well not so much Facebook what if it's Tik Tok these companies these are the some of the largest and most powerful companies in the world they essentially own our children's childhood this is where childhood is taking place on a few giant PL for-profit platforms who that use an Advertising based business model so they are motivated like the Cino to keep them in don't have a clock don't let them see what time it is keep them in don't let them click over to a link to another site keep them in um we somehow have seeded our children's childhood to Giant companies that have shown that they don't really care about our kids welfare they care much more about profitability and and they care about their customers who are the advertisers and these companies have been granted a special RIT from the King Congress said in in in the in section 230 of the communications decency act in 1996 I think it was Congress said oh and nobody sue you nobody can sue you for what you show to their kids uh there was a reason for that that you don't want AOL to be responsible for everything anyone posts but it's been so broadly interpreted that so far any attempt to regulate social media or any attempt to sue them is seen as like no no", "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", "so I think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here too cuz Andrew my big concern with parents is look we've taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which we didn't grow up with as kids and we've told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this um you know when we were growing up you remember the motor vehicle fatalities were really high uh in America and we didn't say okay you know what that's just the price of Modern Life we just have to accept it and keep moving on with our lives we said hold on we don't have to go back to horses and Buggies but we also don't need to accept this death rate we need to make this experience safer and so we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups like Matt and others across the country that me Mothers Against Drunk Driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts airbags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that help helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents and deaths and that's what we need here too like we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting in place safety standards to protect kids from exposure to harmful content from from the experience of bullying and harassment and that also protect them from features that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use uh which is happening far too often right now we also need a policy that requires data transparency from the company you know researchers tell us all the time that they these are independent researchers they tell us they are having a hard time getting full access to the data from the social media platforms about the full impact of the platforms on the mental health of kids and as a parent look I I don't when we bought car seats for my children when when they were born we looked up the safety data like many parents we wanted to make sure the car seats were safe but if you had told me that hey you know the manufacturers of these car seats are actually not disclosing some of the the data on the impact on children uh but go ahead and buy it anyway", 'So,\n- Right.', "It's like-\n- Right. - Well-\n-", 'Like so-\n-', '- Yeah-\n-', 'But-\n-', "oh these terrible devices um rather it's about a vision of childhood which is actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the

iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it any you know anywhere in the house and you can take it outside even although maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the point is um the internet is an amazing thing and you know you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids and they can do things on the computer but you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to so it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone let them have a flip phone or a simple phone watch something like that that's rule number one rule number two is the most relevant for what we're just talking about and that is no social media until 16 there is I believe no way to make social media safe for children that is if they're going to be entering a domain in which Prestige is gained by having posts that get the most likes and followers you're making them be brand managers you're making them be performative this is not playful th", "so you know it is important to clean up the content but for kids going through puberty I think the only real answer is just delay just don't let them do that how much of the issue here is modeling of what adults are doing and um you know and how terrible are or good are adults at modulating their behavior I say modulating because you know I see a lot of parents um videotaping everything that they're you know on the phone all the time in line at the store while their kids are around you know and one of the reasons I think parents like divices so much is that it's a terrific uh lowc cost zero cost um babysitter it allows them to then go be on their phones or do other things yeah so young children are sometimes copying their parents young children are looking for things to copy uh and you know and so I I've got some slides in my regular book lecture of toy iPhones that we give to to ERS so they can be just like Mommy and Daddy um for little kids I think it might matter for teenagers you know I'm very often asked that question because and I think it's because parents they feel a little guilty like they know that they're modeling bad behavior and they're worried like is this setting up my kid for doing that and I can't say for sure but my intuition as a social psychologist is not really not very much and the reason is because you know while your kids once looked up to you and they once copied you like by the time they're 12 13 14", "but they haven't been the other is the sharing and we used to hear about pod parties where somebody buys the device which is more expensive buys the device and then you bring your own not beer bring your own pod which is a few dollars then you pop it in and then you share it around um we've also heard stories of a few teenagers buying them and then selling for a few cents or a few dollars a puff so meet me in the bathroom for 50 cents or a dollar you can have a couple of Puffs so I think teens are getting very very creative we've also seen unfortunately parents buying e cigarettes for their teens well at least they're not smoking cigarettes that's not the right comparison um so I think they're very creative they're getting into many many different ways I've heard students say I'm not using my lunch money to buy lunch I'm going to use it to buy Vapes um there's no one way uh there's not and unfortunately access is easier than it should by the way one thing I think is incredibly important for people to understand is across the US in 2019 December 2019 the legal age to be allowed to purchase or to sell nicotine products across the US is is become 21 so many people think it's so 18"]

Ground Truths: ["COPPA set the age for minors in contracts and data sharing at 13. This aligns with today's views on kids' social media access as there is a push to raise the age to 16, reflecting concerns about the safety and pressure associated with social media for younger children."]

Answer: 

The neurobiologist uses the analogy of junk food to describe the effects of neural circuits on girls' mental health in the context of smartphone and social media use. Specifically, they compare social media to a "super stimulus" like junk food.

The analogy goes as follows: Just as junk food is described as a super stimulus for our taste buds and reward systems, social media acts as a super stimulus for the neural circuits involved in social interactions. The neurobiologist explains that a cheeseburger is a super stimulus, and ice cream is an even more potent "super duper stimulus" because it combines fat and sugar. They then extend this analogy to describe how social media platforms create an even more intense stimulation:

"A cheeseburger with a milkshake and the milkshake has candy in it... ice cream and then you get a toy and they're playing music - I mean that's a dopamine bath."

This analogy illustrates how social media platforms provide an intensified and concentrated form of social interaction that can overwhelm the neural circuits evolved for social behavior, particularly in girls. The rapid, potent, and potentially more severe consequences of these interactions are likened to the effects of consuming highly processed junk food on our reward systems.

long-term goals possible, as well as dopamine\ncenters and the amygdala.\n\nSo there's this really broad\nintegration and testing.\n\nI think this is the key element here, testing of circuits\nfor

the Nuance here because um you're telling me that girls are killing themselves more they're depressed their increase in suicide is larger boys have a much higher suicide rate so boy many more boys die from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or a bridge whereas girls tend to use pills or cutting their wrists and they and the great majority of girl suicide attempts don't lead to death yeah so are most of the issues with girls and online use social

probably even more severe than they used to be", "but it's learning impulse control reinforcement contingencies on what time scale can I get what I want to meet certain drives and to what extent should I suppress those drives and you know traditionally it was I think through religion and parenting and um social cues that you will learn well if I want something is it okay to do it that there are consequences to eating more or less consequences to be okay so it's super complex but but that all happens sometimes in a summer this is what's so amazing to about puberty to me you know or the acquisition of facial hair in in a boy you know suddenly he's looked at differently people will start projecting all sorts of Futures on him you know um but we do this I notice I'm not a child psychologist obviously but as soon as my niece started drawing she's going to be an artist as soon as a boy starts building or a girl starts you know gets a math problem right is going to be a a mathematician I mean we project all this stuff and and there's no question that that feeds back on identity but in terms of online use I can't even imagine how much of this is diminished by only showing a specific part of ourselves and I can't even imagine how much of it is exacerbated in terms of what we are rewarded for during puberty so here's what we know in both animals and humans which is that neuroplasticity while it responds to punishment is exquisitely sensitive become sort of a runaway train for more plasticity under conditions of dopamine reinforcement and reward so you can imagine that the girl using the filter the Instagram filter for who gets rewarded for looking a certain way maybe excessively thin or something or what leads to excessively thin um there's no question that rewards Drive neuroplasticity faster than punishment make sure I understand this you're saying suppose a girl gets uh a girl gets onto Instagram and she's now consuming stuff about being thin and for some reason she finds this rewarding are you saying that the the the quick dopamine circuits or she posts something and she gets likes for it are you saying that that actually will extend neuroplasticity the fact that she's getting more dopamine s rapid dopamine that will make her more neuroplastic and her brain will change more yes it will it will accelerate learning for the whatever contingency led to that whatever led to that so we know this in animals and humans even though they're exquisitly sensitive plasticity is exquisitely sensitive to punishment you know it only takes one shock learning in one corner of a cage or getting sick at one particular restaurant that you don't want to go back again but when it comes to social dynamics we know that reward leads to almost what I would call runaway plasticity in the circuits that generated the behaviors that led to that particular reward I mean it's um and there are a number of experiments that that explain this the work of Mike merenik at UCSF who largely worked on adult plasticity but showed that when you when you activate dopamine release in the brain fortunately both during development but also in adulthood you essentially create a window of super plasticity okay that's dopamine reward that neuromodulator is a window for super plasticity and evolutionarily it makes sense like", "Okay, so there are a million different, there's infinite number of examples here, but the idea is that there\nare two parallel circuits that are important for establishing bonds, and that this is set up\nvery early on in childhood.\n\nAnd that it's neither emotional\nnor rational, but both.\n\nNow both of these circuits\ntap into the circuitry that we talked about earlier, where dopamine is released\nand molecules like serotonin, which again is a neuromodulator more associated with\nfeelings of warmth, comfort, and satisfaction with our\nimmediate surroundings and possessions rather\nthan seeking of things and motivation and drive\nto go look for things, as is the case with dopamine.\n\nSo there's still interactions\nwith those systems, but the work of Allan\nSchore has stimulated a lot of interest in what are the circuits that underlie this autonomic bonding, this matching of heart rate and breathing, and what are the neural circuits that underlie this bonding\nor this synchronization of experience on the\nkind of left brain side.", "and so it talking about Neuroscience like I'm not wired like that 5-year-old is going to be wired because they're growing up in an environment where every day they're checking in on their feelings it reminds me of just another story I was in a school in Brooklyn and I mean kids they this one school's been using our program for a decade and they wanted the kids wanted to meet me and the principal of the school who's my former student um he said you can ask Mark anything and it's like why do you do this and what motivates you and and I was telling these kids the story of my childhood and this one girl she must have been in sixth grade she said to mean it's really hard for me to understand your experience I said why' she's like I've been going to this school since I'm in kindergarten and I can't think of a day that someone didn't ask me how I was feeling it's powerful you know when you think about like her neural development right all the pathways that are being built for this person or these children in thousands of schools to be learning their feelings understanding where they're you know why they're feeling the way they're feeling to interact with other kids and see how they're feeling and how they express their feelings and how they deal with their feelings and learning strategies to together in a Cooperative environment to cultivate and how that gets more complex with development right because in kindergarten you're learning about sadness and disappointment but then you're learning about Despair and alienation and exclusion and that's what makes this work so interesting is that these Concepts evolve throughout our lives right think about it", "so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "If you can understand that, I'm certain you can make it\nthrough the rest of the episode and that you'll get all the\ndepth and important detail that you need to know.\n\nBut I want to go just a little bit further and explain that neurons\ndon't just talk one-to-one.\n\nThere are trillions of\nneurons in your nervous system that allow you to be happy, to be in love, to be sad, to be in grief, to remember things and so on.\n\nAnd what you do at any moment, what you feel and what you think relates to which so-called\nneural circuits are active.\n\nSo a lot of times we\nthink about brain areas and we've all seen these\npictures of the brain where, you know, someone\nwas in a fMRI scanner, or they were in a brain\nscanner of some sort, and they saw a picture of something and a certain area of the\nbrain lights up as it's called.\n\nThat lighting up of the\nbrain really reflects the activity of hundreds,\nif not thousands, maybe even millions of\nneurons in that region.", "These circuits that we're\ncalling pro-social circuits light up in the brain in neuroimaging, meaning the neurons are\nfiring more actively, more electrically robustly; sort of like turning up the volume on these neural circuits in the brain.\n\nAnd the neural circuits in the brain that are associated with\naversive or defensive behaviors; things like backing up things, like covering up the\nvital organs of the body, things like a quaking of the voice, all of the things are associated\nwith defensive behaviors are actually antagonized,\nmeaning they are reduced when the pro-social\ncircuits are more active.\n\nSo the framework here that I'd like to set is that we have this kind of seesaw of neural circuits in the brain.\n\nOne set that are\npro-social and are designed to bring us closer to\nothers, including ourselves, closer to certain sensory\nexperiences, right?\n\nBecause a lot of pro-social behaviors can also be geared towards\nthings like pets or food, or anything that we find\nwe want to be closer to and want more of.", "There's hope for the future, thinking about the symptoms\nas an engineer might, and trying to identify the\ncircuits that are likely working to make this typical behavior happen, and that will help us understand\nhow it becomes atypical. -\n\nSo that seems like the first to me, the first been of this,\nwhat I call the Bento Box for lack of a better analogy, that we need to know the circuits.\n\nWe need to know the cells\nin the various brain regions and end portions of the body and how they connect to one another, and what the patterns of activity are under a normal 'healthy interaction'.\n\n- [Karl] Yeah.\n\n- If we understand that, then\nit seems that the next step, which of course could be\ncarried out in parallel, right?\n\nThough that work can\nbe done alongside work where various elements within\nthose circuits are tweaked just right, like the tuning\nof a piano in the subtle way, or maybe even like the\nreplacement of a whole set of keys if the piano is lacking keys, so to speak.\n\n- Right.", "But in the meantime,\nI want to just discuss the two neural circuits that use dopamine, that use serotonin and oxytocin, and that collaborate with\nthe autonomic nervous system to drive what we call\ndesire, love and attachment.\n\nAnd the three circuits are\nautonomic nervous system, we talked about that one.\n\nThen there's the nervous system components or the neural circuits for\nempathy, for being able to see and respond to indeed\nmatch the emotional tone or the autonomic tone of another.\n\nAnd then there's the third category, and this might surprise some of you, it certainly surprised me, but the data point to the fact\nthat the third neural circuit that's very important\nfor establishing bonds is one associated with positive delusions.\n\nSo given that the neural\ncircuits for empathy are absolutely crucial for falling in love and maintaining stable attachments, I'd like to talk about\nthose neural circuits and what they are.\n\nNow, often when we hear empathy, we think, oh, empathy is really about\nlistening to and really understanding what\nsomebody else is feeling.\n\nMaybe even feeling what they're feeling.\n\nAnd indeed that's the case,\nbut what do we mean by that?\n\nRight?\n\nWhat is it to\nfeel what another feels?\n\nWell, what it means is that their seesaw is driving your seesaw, or your seesaw is somehow\ndriving their seesaw.\n\nThat there's a match in terms\nof the tilt of those seesaws."]

Question: What has been the social and educational impact of the internet on connecting people and knowledge from 2010 to 2015?

Answer: 

The period from 2010 to 2015 marked a significant shift in how people connected and accessed knowledge through the internet, particularly due to the widespread adoption of smartphones and social media platforms.

In 2010, most teenagers were using flip phones primarily as tools for calling and texting to arrange in-person meetups. However, by 2015, the landscape had dramatically changed. The majority of Americans, especially teens, had smartphones with front-facing cameras, high-speed internet, and unlimited texting capabilities. This technological shift enabled people to spend significantly more time on their devices, with some individuals using their phones for 10-15 hours a day.

The introduction of platforms like Instagram, which was designed specifically for smartphone use, further transformed how people interacted online. These platforms allowed for more immediate and visual forms of communication, changing the nature of social interactions.

From an educational perspective, the increased connectivity and access to information brought about by smartphones and high-speed internet continued the trend started by earlier internet technologies. The ability to quickly search for and find answers to questions without needing to visit a library was described as "miraculous." This ease of access to information had the potential to greatly enhance learning opportunities.

However, the social and educational impact of these technologies was not uniformly positive. While the internet and smartphones provided unprecedented access to knowledge and connectivity, they also introduced new challenges:

1. Replacement of in-person connections with online interactions: There was a trend towards valuing online connections, such as followers and friends on social media, potentially at the expense of face-to-face relationships.

2. Changes in communication dynamics: Online communication lacks many of the non-verbal cues present in face-to-face interactions, potentially leading to misunderstandings or more hurtful exchanges.

3. Potential negative effects on mental health: Increased use of social media has been associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and self-harm among young people.

4. Impact on academic performance: Some studies suggested that excessive smartphone and social media use could negatively affect school performance.

5. Exposure to inappropriate content: Young users, particularly girls, became vulnerable to unwanted attention or inappropriate content from strangers worldwide.

It's important to note that while these technologies brought both benefits and challenges, their impact was not uniformly positive or negative. The effects largely depended on how the technology was designed and used. As Dr. Vivek Murthy pointed out, technology itself is not inherently bad, but its impact depends on its design and implementation.

In conclusion, the period from 2010 to 2015 saw a rapid transformation in how people, especially young people, connected and accessed information. While this brought unprecedented opportunities for learning and connectivity, it also introduced new challenges that society is still grappling with today.

groceries or mailing an item out or getting something from the store I can sit in the comfort of my home and have everything just come to me now on the one hand that's incredibly efficient right but I think efficiency is an interesting thing because it's only one factor we should be considering in our lives there too we have to ask the cost and one interesting thing about Co is many people in the first year of Co when we were all separated from one another you know when we finally came back together again I had so many people who said to me you know what I expected to miss my parents and my siblings and my friends not being able to see them what I didn't expect was missing the strangers that I saw at the coffee shop or the folks who I ran into the grocery store or seeing neighbors as I walked down the street like I actually missed that more than I thought I would so we have lost out on some of those interactions and those loose ties but the final thing to keep in mind also is about what is happening with how we are using social media technology which I think is fundamentally transformed how we interact with one another and how we see ourselves and each other and this is particularly true for young people uh who are growing up as digital natives but what has happened there I worry is that and and it's not that social media is all bad just to be clear you know technology look I'm I'm a believer that in technology broadly speaking you know I'm a user of technology I spent seven years building a tech company I'm a Believer in Tech", "but I think whether technology helps or hurts us is about how it's designed and ultimately about how it ends up being used and what we've seen with social media as well is that uh for many people it ended up leading to in-person connections being replaced with online connections um we came to somehow value and um almost seek out more and more followers and friends on social media feeling like somehow that made us more connected but the nature of dialogue also changed like as human beings we evolved over thousands of years to not just understand the words someone is saying but to hear the tone of their voice to see their facial expression like you and I are sitting across and and we're both processing like our body language right and I'm seeing you nod your head and I'm seeing your eyes focused like all of that matters to how we communicate um but also like you and I are less likely to say something hurtful right now to one another because we can see each other if I said something to hurtful to you like i' probably see the the pain or consternation on your face and that might give me pause right when you're communicating online with other people without any of that information or with any of the uh sort of barriers if you will that make you pause before you hurt someone it leads to a very different kind of communication uh one that can be quite hurtful at times", "oh if you're being contacted by strange men around the world who want to have sex with you like that's not good for 11 12 year old girls so it's all these different potential harms and then imagine all these different potential effects S one of which is depression and another is anxiety another is self harm but there's doing worse in school there's becoming more shallow there's uh conflicts with your so there's a whole bunch and then we want to look at the causal connections and what I'm trying to draw out is suppose you we suppose we could quantify the degree to which sheer time just spending five hours a day does that make you more anxious automatically well maybe a little um but that's probably not the main effect so there's a gigantic multicausal network of effects now um I have good numbers for how much the how much teenss are using these devices and these platforms today um Pew in particular did has done a great job of of tracking changes in this since the ear since the 2000s what we know today from both Pew and Gallup is that young people in America are now spending about five hours a day just on social media just social media", 'ANDREW HUBERMAN: And the last\nexample that leaps to mind-- I think social media\nand online culture has been accused of creating\na lot of real world-- let\'s call it physical world\nsocial anxiety for people.\n\nBut I could imagine practicing\na social interaction.\n\nOr a kid that has a\nlot of social anxiety or that needs to advocate\nfor themselves better learning how to do\nthat progressively through a virtual\ninteraction, and then taking that to the real world because,\nin my very recent experience today, it\'s so blended\nnow with real experience that the kid that\nfeels terrified of advocating for\nthemselves, or just talking to another human\nbeing, or an adult, or being in a new circumstance\nof a room full of kids, you could really experience\nthat in silico first and get comfortable,\nlet the nervous system attenuate a bit, and then take\nit into the, quote unquote, "physical world."', "I I guess is is there I like to think there's a way to step back from that and observe it not from a disconnected stance but from a place of curiosity about what's driving the those mechanisms in people and and maybe where we need to adjust our thinking maybe not to adopt their mode of thinking 100 but maybe you know 10 or 2 I think one of the the reasons things are so divisive right now is because of social media and the siloing or of kind of Orchard very um Divergent trajectories of people only following and listening to and obeying certain kinds of information and other people the other and I think the pandemic is the place where all that really clashed very heavily um and continues to Clash in other areas too um certainly not something that's going to be solved um inside of this conversation and yet I do have um a question that that grows from this aspect of our discussion which is you know what do you think can be done at a concrete level in terms of Education of younger people as well as educational people who are out of high school and and Beyond to try and adopt these more um encompassing modes of of learning and experiencing the world I mean it's one thing to say you know expose yourself to lots of different ideas um it's another to to understand how to how to do that in a way that that is um adaptive and that any ideas you have um I think what I know I and the audience would really appreciate and and feel free to to um make this an editorial um or or map back to data I mean obviously this is your wheelhouse this is this is your expertise", "MARK ZUCKERBERG: Sure.\n\nI mean, I think this is\na really important topic.\n\nThe research that we've\ndone suggests that it's not all good or all bad.\n\nI think how you're\nusing the technology has a big impact on\nwhether it is basically a positive experience for you.\n\nAnd even within technology,\neven within social media, there's not one type of\nthing that people do.\n\nI think, at its best, you're\nforming meaningful connections with other people.\n\nAnd there's a lot of research\nthat basically suggests that it's the\nrelationships that we have and the friendships that bring\nthe most happiness in our lives and, at some level,\nend up even correlating with living a longer\nand healthier life because that grounding\nthat you have in community ends up being\nimportant for that.\n\nSo I think that aspect\nof social media, which is the ability to connect\nwith people, to understand what's going on\nin people's lives, have empathy for them,\ncommunicate what's going on with your life,\nexpress that, that's generally positive."]

Ground Truths: ['The social and educational impact of the internet on connecting people and knowledge from 2010 to 2015 includes massive gains in knowledge and productivity due to enhanced connectivity. The internet allowed for free communication and access to information, making it easier for individuals to find answers without needing to visit a library. This period marked a significant change in how people interacted and shared information, leading to both positive advancements and some disruptions in society.']

Question: What is one of the main functions of the prefrontal cortex in relation to the hypothalamus?

Answer: 

One of the main functions of the prefrontal cortex in relation to the hypothalamus is to provide inhibitory control over the hypothalamus's impulse-driven actions. The prefrontal cortex has extensive connections with the hypothalamus, which is responsible for many motivated drives and basic functions like temperature regulation, sexual drive, hunger, and aggression.

The prefrontal cortex acts as a kind of "brake" on these brain centers, including the hypothalamus. It can suppress or quiet the activity of the hypothalamus through a process called top-down inhibition. This inhibitory function allows for more context-specific behavior and thinking, rather than purely reflexive or impulse-driven actions.

For example, the prefrontal cortex enables us to override reflexes or resist urges that originate from the hypothalamus. This ability to suppress impulses is crucial for complex decision-making and social behavior. It allows us to stay in situations that might be uncomfortable (like a cold shower) or to resist immediate gratification in favor of long-term goals.

This inhibitory relationship between the prefrontal cortex and the hypothalamus develops significantly during puberty and continues to be refined throughout adulthood. The ability of the prefrontal cortex to suppress hypothalamic impulses is a key aspect of what makes human behavior flexible and adaptable to different contexts.

within the ventromedial hypothalamus just nearby and uh you'd want to go spend some time with your wife alone let's just put it that way I mean a remarkable specificity of the neuronal outputs to

of your podcast you talked about how TMS to the prefrontal cortex can slow heart rate so I meant in that in that sort of way got it that that that yeah by by that by influencing cortical function will

ability through what's called top-down inhibition to quiet other brain areas so for instance if you are feeling agitated but you need to sit still your ability to sit still even if it takes a bit of work is coordinated by your prefrontal cortex sending inhibitory suppressive electrical signals to the networks of your brain that are trying to generate physical action in addition to that if you are in a conversation that's either a difficult one or a boring one or you are tempted to interrupt and you are actively holding back your desire to walk away or to yawn or to blurt something out it's your prefrontal cortex that is controlling that active suppression so in many ways you can just think of the prefrontal cortex as an Orchestra conductor that is essentially saying shh or not right now be quiet this is not the time to many different brain networks all at once now in addition to that your prefrontal cortex is coordinating with other brain networks that are involved in generating what's called salience or attention to particular signals so the prefrontal cortex in many ways is like a teacher or an Orchestra conductor it can point to in the neurochemical sense that is 0.2 a given brain structure and say you", "but it it certainly is involved um when thinking about the frontal cortex I often think about its connections with other areas of the brain so maybe we could talk

Question: What challenges do unaccompanied children face when they are seen playing outside without adult supervision?

Answer: 

Unaccompanied children face several challenges when playing outside without adult supervision in today's society. These challenges stem from significant shifts in societal norms and perceptions of child safety over the past few decades.

One major challenge is the increased risk of intervention by well-meaning but overly cautious neighbors or passersby. In recent years, there has been a growing tendency for people to view unaccompanied children as potentially neglected or in danger. This can lead to situations where authorities are called, even when children are simply engaging in normal play activities. For example, there have been instances where police were called because an 8-year-old was seen unaccompanied, despite this being a common occurrence in previous generations.

Another significant challenge is the potential for legal repercussions for parents. In some jurisdictions, allowing children to play unsupervised can be interpreted as evidence of child neglect. This ambiguity in laws has led to situations where parents face involvement from child protective services, custody battles, and increased supervision, simply for allowing their children a degree of independence that was once considered normal.

Children also face the challenge of missing out on crucial developmental experiences. Unstructured, unsupervised play is essential for children to learn important life skills such as negotiating with peers, resolving conflicts, recognizing social cues, and developing independence. The lack of these experiences can potentially impact their social and emotional development.

Furthermore, children today often lack the opportunity for adventure and exploration that previous generations enjoyed. This reduction in independence and free play can lead to fewer memorable experiences and potentially impact their ability to develop resilience and problem-solving skills.

To address these challenges, organizations like Let Grow (let grow.org) are advocating for changes in laws and societal attitudes. They have successfully pushed for legislation in eight states that protects parents from neglect charges for allowing their children reasonable independence. These efforts aim to restore a more balanced approach to childhood independence and play.

It's important to note that while there are genuine safety concerns, the actual risk of serious incidents like child abduction is much lower than commonly perceived. According to FBI statistics, there are only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings per year in the entire United States, most of which involve family members rather than strangers.

In conclusion, while unsupervised play was once a normal part of childhood, today's children face significant challenges in enjoying this freedom due to changed societal perceptions, legal risks for parents, and missed developmental opportunities. Efforts are being made to address these issues and restore a more balanced approach to childhood independence.

social capital is a foreign attack and of course Pearl Harbor did more for American Co coherence than anything else in history in modern history 911 did that too but only for a little while and then we we lost it um so for a a lot of reasons people trusted their neighbors kids were out playing you know my parents grew up in the depression in New York City the kids were all out playing stickball on the street or in a parking lot in the 1970s there is a real crime wave um crime goes through the roof actually and it goes through the 80s that goes all the way to the early 90s even still you were kicked out of the house to go play um even in New York City all kids went out to play that's just the way it was but we begin to lose trust in each other for a lot of reasons Robert putam wrote about this in Bowling alone the the the the loss of Social Capital many reasons for that the changing media environment air conditioning and television people are not hanging out on their porch in the summertime to get away from the Heat they Clos the door and they put on the AC and they watch TV family sizes are shrinking there are not that many kids around so for a lot of reasons by the the 90s is the key decade where act two of the tragedy happens and that's the loss of the play-based childhood", "so I I co-founded an organization called let grow if you go to let grow.org um with Lenor ski

it's more of an general information Source but the point is especially the short videos the short videos are really really addictive because the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the house every day to go play my mom would say get out of the house I now realize she wanted space yeah", "I love what your mom did getting you guys outside um my parents did the same thing too like we I was very blessed to have two parents who didn't come you know they didn't have a lot of resources growing up they didn't come to this country with a lot of resources but the one of the greatest gifts they G gave us is that they loved us uncondition Al the other great gift that they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out", "I mean it's crazy what happens so eight states have now said no no more of that this is insane um so we so law could help to put to to stop incentivizing helicopter parenting to provide uh uh more spaces that are safe for kids to play in not car zones um so the book has the exas generation the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "look you guys actually you can see what this is doing to you you mostly agree that this is wasting your time it's garbage you you want to way out but you just feel like you can't there's such resignation um but look the cool kids over there they have flip phones and they're out like every day after school they're like you know they're doing stuff they're down at you know they're in the mall they're they're getting pizza they're you know building a fort uh you know whatever depending on the age um so I think the way out is to give kids an exciting childhood kids are so lonely now and and they they don't have much in the way of Adventure they don't have much in the way of Thrills um you know you know I live I live in New York City um you know I would start I would like bring my kids out to Coney Island when they were you know 9 10 years old bring them out and then I would just say I'm just going to sit here you guys run around you guys go have fun like I'm not going to be with you you know you know yeah there's a chance you'll get kidnapped or struck by lightning although lightning is more likely um so and then it you know and then it got once they were you know in more you know like like 13 now they can actually take the subway out to Coney Island with a friend so um that's cool", "so that's the third Norm is uh no uh is phonefree schools you have to lock up the phone in the morning either a lock in a phone lock or Yonder pouch um if the policy is you keep in your pocket that's not a policy that's just a recipe for constant conflict with the kids because they can't help it they have to text if anyone's texting they have to be texting and the fourth Norm is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real world because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing we have to do is restore a really fun adventurous childhood like you know what you were saying you know you go out on your bicycle you're hanging out with your friends friends sometimes something happens and boy you have memories I mean exciting things happen scary things happen you have memories and you know I worry about like what you know what boys today you know I have a group of Buddy my group of friends that I you know we we still talk about things that happened you know things that amazing things that happened when we were in college or after college and I wonder what boys young boys today are going to say you know you remember fortnite game 27363 where you were trapped in that Elevator Shaft and I had to shoot you out no I don't remember that one you know like uh the the virtual Adventures are just not going to cut it our kids need Adventure they need Independence and Adventure uh where they work out the conflicts themselves", "so in America and Britain we freaked out about child abduction and child sexual abuse um some of the scandals were real the Boy Scouts the Catholic Church there were cases where trusted organizations were covering up abuse and I recall the abduction thing the carton y thing right and there was a show I think my name is Brian you know about the kid who was abducted and then all he remembered I think it's a true story was that his name was Brian he would just remind himself every night about his real name you know I think they found him eventually in Berkeley mhm not calling out Berkeley I lived in Berkeley for a long time but um seemed to be the discovery of of Abu of abducted kid excuse me in Berkeley uh there are a few other cases there I don't know what that's about um in any of I grew up thinking that you could get kidnapped right yeah which yeah which is so it's I mean it's the most terrifying possibility for any parent um but when I was doing the research for the codling the American mind I found according to FBI statistics there's only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings a year in our whole country because if a child like who would take a child like it's a really difficult crime and you're going to you know who would steal a child from a store you know parents are afraid if your kid goes to the next D on the grocery store going to be how are you going to take a kicking and screaming kid out of a store um it's and yet sorry to interrupt but the show America's Most Wanted I believe was hosted by a guy whose kid was abducted and eventually found dead exactly Adam that's right right so so there was this propagation of this fear like that one of the deepest fears of any parent I can to imagine is is is that that's right but the point is that these crimes are extraordinarily rare it's almost always the non-custodial parent who takes a kid it's a family member because there's a fight within the family um so we fear the wrong things we're terrified of kidnapping um but locking our kids up overprotecting them has spiked the suicide rate so much that the death toll is vastly higher from the extra suicides than it would be if we could completely wipe out kidnapping which again doesn't"]

Ground Truths: ["Unaccompanied children face challenges such as being reported to the police by concerned neighbors, which can lead to involvement from Child Protective Services. This can result in custody battles and restrictions on family supervision, as the system may perceive the child's unsupervised play as evidence of neglect."]

Question: What perspective does a neurobiologist provide on the issues related to boys and their mental health?

Answer: 

From a neurobiological perspective, the issues related to boys and their mental health are closely tied to the neural circuits associated with sex and violence. These circuits have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years and are particularly heightened in boys.

In the modern context, these neural circuits are being stimulated in extreme ways. For example, boys are exposed to increasingly intense pornographic content, which has evolved from relatively tame material like Playboy magazines to hardcore content featuring extreme acts. Similarly, violent video games provide a potent stimulus for these circuits.

The neurobiologist's view suggests that these modern stimuli act as "super stimuli" for the male brain, similar to how junk food acts as a super stimulus for our taste receptors. This overstimulation can lead to a sort of "dopamine bath," potentially trapping boys in cycles of seeking these intense experiences.

It's important to note that while girls are experiencing higher rates of depression and suicide attempts, boys still have a much higher suicide completion rate. This is partly due to boys tending to use more violent means when attempting suicide.

The neurobiological perspective also highlights the role of hormones in brain development. Testosterone, which is converted to estrogen in the brain, plays a crucial role in organizing the "male" brain during development. This process is complex and involves counterintuitive biological flips, challenging simplistic notions of how sex hormones influence brain development.

In comparison to girls, whose mental health issues often manifest as anxiety, depression, and self-criticism, boys' issues seem to be more externally directed, potentially due to these heightened neural circuits related to sex and violence.

This neurobiological view provides insight into why boys might be particularly vulnerable to certain types of mental health issues in the modern digital age, where super stimuli are readily available and can potentially hijack these evolved neural circuits.

from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or a bridge whereas girls tend to use pills or cutting their wrists and they and the great majority of girl suicide attempts don't lead to death yeah so are most of the issues with girls and online use social

specific what is happening to the brain during puberty that would be relevant here to a sensitive period okay so this goes back to the biology that you accurately described earlier which is that while we're in utero if there's a y chromosome then a bunch of genes are made like mulian an inhibiting hormone the malarian ducts become inhibited um the testes grow then testosterone is secreted and testosterone and some of its derivatives like dihydro testosterone organize the brain quote unquote male this is dangerous language nowadays but it's less dangerous now than it was two years ago okay

sense of Duty and how they're supposed to be in the world um I would think just the way I just laid out the little you know by all admittance like just very Antiquated now view of maleness um that they would be thinking a lot about what's going on it would meet some of the daily practices that you talked about earlier um that there would be reflection that there would be um Consciousness there would be um uh an understanding of one's Shadow or if one were to add in the the other stereotype that went with it that they drink a lot right that was very much I'll remember my first I went to graduate school first at Berkeley before I shifted to a different place um and I was told when I got there that it used to be that the faculty and graduate students of which at that time in the 1970s and 60s was mostly male mostly now that's changed fortunately right that they would meet every day after work to drink and then stagger home to their Partners every day and I was shocked like are you kidding me I was like no every single day so you know the the idea here is that um that was the old view now things are very different but what about the work of men men and boys to try and understand

over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself

Question: How did smartphones and Instagram affect teen interactions by 2015?

Answer: 

By 2015, smartphones and Instagram had significantly altered teen interactions compared to just five years earlier. In 2010, most teenagers were using flip phones primarily as tools to call or text each other and arrange in-person meetups. However, the period from 2010 to 2015 saw what Dr. Jonathan Haidt calls "the Great rewiring of childhood."

By 2015, several key changes had occurred:

1. Smartphone adoption: The majority of American teenagers had smartphones with front-facing cameras.

2. Instagram emergence: Instagram became the first social media platform that required a smartphone for use, and it was particularly popular among girls.

3. Increased connectivity: Teens had access to high-speed internet and unlimited texting.

4. Extended screen time: It became possible for teens to spend 10-15 hours a day on their phones, which was not feasible with flip phones.

These changes led to several effects on teen interactions:

1. Increased digital communication: Teens could now interact constantly through their smartphones, even when physically apart.

2. Visual-based interactions: With front-facing cameras and platforms like Instagram, interactions became more visually oriented.

3. Viral spread of information: Mistakes or embarrassing moments could now spread rapidly and widely, unlike in the pre-smartphone era when such incidents might only be known to a small group.

4. Marketing and peer influence: Teens gained more access to marketing content, including from peers promoting products or behaviors on platforms like YouTube.

5. Reduced face-to-face interaction: There were concerns about teens spending more time on phones instead of engaging in direct social interactions or outdoor activities.

6. Potential impact on social and physical development: Questions arose about how the shift from in-person play and communication to phone-based interaction might affect teens' development.

While these changes brought some benefits, such as increased communication and support networks, they also raised concerns about social anxiety, depression, and the potential for cyberbullying. The rapid adoption of smartphones and social media platforms like Instagram fundamentally changed how teens interacted, communicated, and spent their time by 2015.

has changed things and so um if we if we look at a kid let's take a teenager in 2010 and let's say January 2010 at that point there's no Instagram there's no front-facing camera um they all have mostly they have flip phones the iPhone came out in 2007 uh but they don't mostly have them so in 2010 most teenagers are using the flip phone as a tool to call each other call each other text each

risk behavior but it's more the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "so you can have two parents who are married and living in the same home and may or may not be a good relationship but living in the same home if there's no conflict or that then generally teens will do well or as you're saying there's not necessarily a direct correlation the problem comes in whether parents are living at home together or separated or divorced is if there's conflict and then that conflict tends to result in social issues emotional issues a lot of social anxiety a lot of feeling like I need to do better so that way my parents like me more and we see that with children too that's not just adolescence a lot of depression and with depression can come self-medication and uh self-medicating around other drugs and so on but that generally is resolved if the conflict resolves but as you're saying we're seeing adolescent angst regardless of parenting uh what we really need though it's not a matter of just the divorce or not divorce or the relationship between the parents it's parenting that's important so parents being good monitors being involved in their kids' lives not this oh you're 16 you have a car you can go wherever you want and we're not going to keep an eye on you we still need parents to monitor to pay attention to find out their kids' friends where are they going after school that discretionary time when parents are working and teenagers come home between 3 and 5 or 3 and six tends to be the most risky couple of hours they're it's called discretionary hours where there's no parent around and we don't always know where those teenagers are hanging out so that's more important knowing where their children are and what they're doing and that there's some adult presence some monitoring then whether or not they're still in a relationship my sense is that smartphones have allowed more communication and monitoring between parents and kids but also more interactions between kids and other kids and kids and adults more broadly so is there any evidence that uh the Advent of smartphones is directly creating problems for kids that um has to do with just so much more PE PE to peer interaction or peer to-peer exposure like when I was growing up we didn't have smartphones uh if you did something stupid like that meaning that kids would laugh at it might get told to a small group of people maybe a larger group of people but um in general it just kind of didn't go anywhere you're like a I screwed up and then You' get teased a bit and then it would kind of dissipate", "yeah I uh have family relatives with um who are in their teens and it's interesting to see them interact um where they're on their phones a lot of the time but I've also noticed that there's a cohort of kids that are really trying to put their phones away and just spend time together and that was actually directly stated to me that oh yeah we hang out and we make it a point not to be on our phones when we hang out and then but then of course they'll text or be on the iPad with one another in the evening when they're apart so they're sort of never apart right um but I do think there seems to be at least a sub movement of um kids and teens that are trying to do more face Toof face interaction with devices at least put aside I answer a really good point I've talked to some teens who say that they all they get together and they will deliberately put the phones face down in the middle no phones and have dinner have a conversation so I I think you're right I definitely think that that that has been a movement and I really appreciate that and I think that's fantastic I've also seen circumstances where two teens are trying to help each other with homework and they're texting each other which is fine but I've often said why don't you just pick up the phone and call the person and in five minutes you can figure out the math assignment instead of 20 30 minutes of back and forth", "so I I point to that it's that 5-year period 2010 to 2015 which I've called the Great rewiring of childhood because it affects everything everything about what children and teenagers are doing I can recall in 2010 I was actually in New York City visiting friends I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting yeah nowadays I think of it less as addicting but almost um like an an OCD of sorts and here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD but the interesting thing about OCD is that the compulsions the behaviors don't serve to reduce the obsessions rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them and in many ways I feel like smartphone use and social media use in particular is a OCD of sorts it's not just habit it's not just an addiction it's an obsessive compulsive Loop so it's already a struggle to pay attention and you know ancient Traditions have have taught techniques to improve your focus your attention we're easily distracted and um you know so I don't work on my phone very much because I I hate to type on the phone and and I'm always at a computer but even for me sitting at my computer as soon as the thinking gets hard as soon as if I'm writing if I'm doing something that requires concentration some little part of my brain says I wonder what the weather's going to be and I go check the weather or you know oh did I get any email I go check my I might check my email you know probably 40 50 times a day and I know that's terrible so the question is is it a compulsion where I feel pulled I have to check it or something bad will happen no it's more like imagine trying to do your work imagine trying to be a kid in school and you have on your desk in front of you you have your television set your record player a walkie talk to talk to your friends a guitar a painting set all array in front of you and your teacher is telling you about you know geometry what are you going to do probably one of these things and so I think the smartphone where a flip phone it's it's a tool you pull it out if you want to talk to someone then you put it away but the smartphone there's no reason to ever put it away talk to us about the scary statistics there's just no way around this yeah", "oh if you're being contacted by strange men around the world who want to have sex with you like that's not good for 11 12 year old girls so it's all these different potential harms and then imagine all these different potential effects S one of which is depression and another is anxiety another is self harm but there's doing worse in school there's becoming more shallow there's uh conflicts with your so there's a whole bunch and then we want to look at the causal connections and what I'm trying to draw out is suppose you we suppose we could quantify the degree to which sheer time just spending five hours a day does that make you more anxious automatically well maybe a little um but that's probably not the main effect so there's a gigantic multicausal network of effects now um I have good numbers for how much the how much teenss are using these devices and these platforms today um Pew in particular did has done a great job of of tracking changes in this since the ear since the 2000s what we know today from both Pew and Gallup is that young people in America are now spending about five hours a day just on social media just social media"]

Ground Truths: ['By 2015, smartphones and Instagram significantly changed teen interactions, as the majority of American teens had smartphones with front-facing cameras, allowing them to engage on social media platforms like Instagram. This shift enabled teens to spend 10 to 15 hours a day on their phones, a level of engagement that was not possible with the flip phones they primarily used in 2010.']

Question: What content types and time limits are suggested for youth safety on social media?

Answer: 

For youth safety on social media, several content types and time limits are suggested:

Time limits:
- Delay social media use until after middle school at minimum
- Limit social media use to less than 3 hours per day, as using it for 3 hours or more doubles the risk of anxiety or depression symptoms
- Create tech-free zones, including:
  - The hour before bedtime and throughout the night
  - During meal times
  - During in-person social interactions like birthday parties

Content types to be cautious of or avoid:
- Harassment or bullying from strangers
- Content that promotes self-harm or suicidal thoughts
- Inappropriate approaches from strangers, especially for young girls
- Content that negatively impacts body image
- Angry or vitriolic content that leaves users feeling worse

To promote youth safety, parents and caregivers should:
1. Start a dialogue with children about their social media use and experiences
2. Help children understand what is not acceptable to experience on social media
3. Encourage reporting of concerning content or interactions
4. Lead by example in managing their own social media use

It's important to note that while social media can have some benefits, such as self-expression and finding support, these benefits should not come at the cost of exposing children to potential harms. Parents should be aware that adolescents spend an average of 3.5 hours per day on social media, which can negatively impact sleep, physical activity, and self-esteem.

By implementing these time limits and being mindful of content, parents can help protect youth from the potential negative impacts of social media while still allowing for its positive aspects.

they see a friend post that they're thinking of taking their own life or harming themsel in another way you want them to know that that's important to flag and to get help you know that they shouldn't just you know scroll past that so that conversation is really important and finally as parents we can lead by example right and this is hard because the truth is we've been talking about social media and youth and that's what the subject of my search and General's advisory was on but I have concerns about adults too I said as somebody who's had challenges in my own use you know of social media finding sometimes it bleeds you know past my bedtime and I'm realized you know I think m&a checked something for 5 minutes an hour later I'm still there you know scrolling through something uh and sometimes I you know you know I find myself over the years I found myself comparing myself also to posts I see online and unhealthy ways sometimes I find myself um sort of pulled into uh content uh

though our kids are being raised in hara's Casino you know like like no we've got to stop this last year I had the opportunity to speak to to some of the groups at these companies that are assigned to controlling the well-being of the young people that use their platforms and the major emphasis was on the type of content so protecting them against child Predators protecting them against pornography um but as you recall at the beginning of the conversation we broke things down into variables of time specific content Dynamics and maybe the visual interface itself I think for sake of today's discussion the visual interface is probably the least interesting but I can just tell you looking things up close uh a lot not good the eyeball lengthens you become nearsighted which is why spending two hours outside um even if on a tablet has been shown to offset myopia and oh wow thousands of people children anyway there's that piece but the time piece is interesting right maybe limiting the total amount of time on social media obviously the content issue is it only takes one exposure to a video of the sort that you described The Gauntlet I never want to see it whatever has to be done to my phone so that I never see it please uh let me know", "so I would protect that time hour before bed throughout the night I would also create make sure meal times uh were Tech free zone so that people actually that you talk to one another you see one another and time with friends and family members when you're out you know at a birthday party Etc make that Tech free time let them focus on their time with other people those three Tech free zones can do a world of good uh to help your child and then the last thing I'd recommend here the many things I think parents could do is to start a dialogue with your child about their use of social media um we don't always know how social media is making our kids feel uh from the and we may realize when we talk to them that they actually have their own concerns they might say yeah it's not making me feel really good but it's just like hard not to be on it everyone's like texting on this or everyone is uh you know everyone's you know sharing information and posting pictures on it I feel like I need to be on it you can only help them start to manage that if you know that that's a challenge that they're having so opening a conversation so your child knows that you're not judging them", "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", "so if ever there was a call for kids to get out into non-screen life let's call it um and engage uh their nervous system that way it without question is going to benefit them in terms of their ability to learn and retain information perform well in school which is not everything life's about but let's face it we still live in a society where hitting those milestones on a consistent basis are the best is the best predictor of people being able to you know live self-sustained lives build families and that sort of thing so um you mentioned a few actionable M uh items for parents as it relates to kids maybe well not maybe limits their screen time force them outside in the safe weather and safe conditions of course but uh what about adults as well I what what can we all do um should we be restricting our screen time to X number of hours per today I mean you're the Surgeon General if you had a magic wand which I realize you don't um and you could make a uh a highly informed recommendation about what the thresholds for too much uh time on social media are um what would it be two hours three hours yeah it's it's a good question and let me actually go through some of these things that parents can can do for kids and that we can all do for ourselves with kids in particular um what I would do specifically with social media is and this is this is frankly what I'm planning to do with my wife for our kids as they grow up number one I would seek to delay the use of social media past Middle School uh at at minimum and I know that that is hard to do at a time where all kids are on social media and you don't want your child to be the only one left out and to be lonely as a result so that means no account of their own means no account of their own okay and I would make see to the best of your ability see if there are other parents that you can partner with to do this because it's hard to do alone as a parent but it's also if there are other parents you're partnering with that means there other kids who are also delaying you so that means your child is not alone and I think if you start the conversation with other parents you'll realize a lot of them are worried about the same things you are they may have thought about delaying you but they also don't want their kid to be the only one so this becomes a numbers challenge but partnership can help us if your child's already on social media what I'd recommend is to create sacred spaces in their lives that are technology free and specifically I would think about the hour before bedtime and throughout the night as time that you want to protect because kids are losing not just sleep because they're going to sleep later because they're on their devices but they're also waking up in the middle of the night maybe to use a bathroom maybe to get some water and then they get back on their devices again so the quality of their sleep is being significantly impacted by access to those devices during the night", "oh if you're being contacted by strange men around the world who want to have sex with you like that's not good for 11 12 year old girls so it's all these different potential harms and then imagine all these different potential effects S one of which is depression and another is anxiety another is self

Question: How do key diet components affect mental/physical health, especially for stress and vitality?

Answer: 

Key diet components significantly impact both mental and physical health, particularly in relation to stress management and overall vitality. Here's how some crucial dietary factors affect our wellbeing:

1. Quality of food sources: Consuming non-processed or minimally processed foods is essential for optimal health. These foods provide the necessary macronutrients (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) that support both physical and mental health.

2. Caloric intake: Maintaining an appropriate caloric balance is crucial. Undereating can lead to increased stress and cortisol output, while overeating can result in energy toxicity, negatively affecting both body composition and mental health.

3. Antioxidants: Foods rich in antioxidants, such as dark leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables, help reduce reactive oxygen species in the body, which can contribute to better stress management and overall health.

4. Fiber and gut health: Consuming adequate fiber, probiotics, and prebiotics supports gut health, which is increasingly recognized as crucial for both physical and mental wellbeing.

5. Nutrient timing: Some people benefit from specific eating patterns like intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding, which can influence energy levels and mental clarity.

6. Hydration: While not explicitly mentioned in the context, proper hydration is implied as part of overall nutrition and is crucial for both physical and mental performance.

7. Adaptogens: Certain compounds found in foods or supplements can help the body adapt to and buffer stress, potentially improving resilience and vitality.

It's important to note that individual responses to different dietary approaches can vary. What works best for one person may not be ideal for another. The key is to find a nutritional approach that provides sufficient, high-quality calories and nutrients while supporting your personal health goals and lifestyle.

Additionally, it's crucial to recognize that diet is just one component of overall health. For optimal mental and physical wellbeing, nutrition should be combined with other lifestyle factors such as regular exercise, quality sleep, stress management techniques, and social connections.

through a bit more quickly than I have the previous two because we've done entire series on these or I should say serieses serieses is that how you pronounce it someone put the plural of serieses in the show in the comments on YouTube the third pillar is movement and when I say movement I mean exercise as you all know we should all strive to get anywhere from 180 to 220 minutes of Zone 2 cardio per week that's movement that allows you to hold a conversation but where you to do it more intensely or even a bit more intensely you wouldn't be able to hold that conversation in addition we should do some V2 Max work we should get our heart rate very high at least once a week doing some sort of movement that's safe for you so that could be running or cycling or swimming or Pilates whatever it is for you getting your heart rate way way up is also important and to do that at least once a week but daily movement either cardiovascular training or resistance training and it's very very clear that we need both maybe not on the same days in fact I split them to separate days resistance training done for anywhere from six to 10 sets per muscle group either close to or to failure this could be with weights it could be with bands it could be with machines all of that was covered in detail in the podcast series that I did with Dr Andy Galpin an exercise physiologist who's expert in all those areas I also did an episode on a foundational Fitness protocol that has been distilled into a very simple three-page PDF that you can get for completely zero cost by going to hu lab.com and just put foundational Fitness protocol PDF and you'll be taken to that toolkit so all of the details of a weekly exercise routine that involves daily movement but also certainly in my case includes at least one full day of rest per week because many people do indeed need one maybe even two full days of rest per week so that highlights the third pillar movement but we know that cardiovascular training and resistance training aren't just great for our body they also improve mood and mental health that's so very clear from the research literature so we can't Overlook those in a conversation about mood and mental health now the fourth pillar is nutrition and nutrition is a big topic it's a very barbed wire topic if you get involved in this stuff online you know you you've got your people who believe that you know carnivore is better than vegan you have the people who believe vegan is better than carnivore most people are omnivores you have your seed oil debates and on and on and on we're not going to touch any of that now indeed if you want to learn more about nutrition and what works and what doesn't work for sake of aesthetic changes weight loss muscle gain Etc I would refer you to the guest episode that we did with Dr Lane Norton you can find that again at huberman lab.com where we do a deep dive on all the variations in different nutritional protocols but suffice to say that regardless of whether or not you're vegan omnivore carnivore or keto or whatever everybody needs to consume sufficient amounts but not excess amounts of quality calories per day now you may do that by intermittent fasting you may do that by a more traditional meal scheduling but everybody's going to need to do that because your body and brain and indeed the parts of your body and brain that translate to mood and mental health require macronutrients proteins fats and carbohydrates as well as micronutrients so the key takeaway with nutrition is to make it quality nutrition within the bounds of whatever sort of nutritional program that you're following and that means getting most of your food sources from either nonprocessed or minimally processed foods so these would be foods that you're going to need to prepare or foods that would perish um over time these are not the sorts of foods that live in boxes and cans and other uh packages that would allow them to live on the shelves forever and ever okay and as I say that I know many people are shouting well what about rice you know rice can live on the shelf for a long time and yes okay I consider rice a minimally processed food because of course it can live on the shelf for a long period of time and here I'm just going to back out of the whole conversation about nutrition at this point because as you can probably tell it's a deep series of rabbit holes that we can fall into and really get distracted the point is make sure you're getting enough food don't overeat we know energy toxicity is a problem for not just body composition but for mental health so you want to get enough calories but not too few calories and you want to make sure that you're getting them from quality sources", "and then I'd love to transition from there into talking about some of the work that you've been doing on stress and stress related eating and stress and how it relates to Aging in particular but before we do that um to get make sure everyone's on the same page um if you could just uh pepper our minds with knowledge about stress and all its um beautiful and not so beautiful forms so when we think about stress we usually think feeling stress you know reporting stress and that's important what are bodies doing is also important it's not always related to our minds so measuring levels of the nervous system and how Vigilant we are is another way that we can understand stress and that's particularly important and interesting because that's how stress gets under the skin and we might not be aware we might not report stress but we're still holding tension and being much more sympathetically dominated meaning that we're our body is Vigilant and scanning for cues and we don't feel safe and so we're mobilizing a lot more energy than we need to and stress is so expensive to the body the stress response uses a tremendous amount of energy ATP that's made by your mitochondria and if we have that kind of vigilant stress response on all day we're just going to feel exhausted and we all feel exhausted at this stage of the kind of long shadow of the pandemic and it's really no mystery because we're not good at turning the stress response off and that's what we want to really focus on is understanding we need to mount a big stress response to cope with things when we need extra energy but then we can actually let our body relax and we can turn it off and that's where the rumination comes and we want to catch ourselves rehearsing and reliving stress or worrying about the next thing saying right now I'm safe and you know there's the breathing strategies I'm right with you where those are the most direct and fast path to reducing stress in the body period", "Now, there are a plethora of things that will also

Question: How does outdoor play and autonomy in childhood shape memories and growth compared to today's digital interactions?

Answer: 

Outdoor play and autonomy in childhood have historically played a crucial role in shaping memories and fostering personal growth, in ways that differ significantly from today's digital interactions.

In the past, children were often encouraged to spend time outside, exploring their neighborhoods and engaging in unstructured play. This type of childhood experience provided numerous benefits for development. Unstructured playtime allowed children to learn essential social skills, such as negotiating situations with peers, resolving conflicts, and recognizing non-verbal cues in others. These experiences on playgrounds and in neighborhoods helped children develop collaboration skills and learn how to interact with others effectively.

Moreover, the autonomy granted to children in previous generations allowed for more adventurous and memorable experiences. Children were often "kicked out of the house" to play, giving them the freedom to explore their surroundings, ride bikes around the neighborhood, and engage in various activities without constant adult supervision. This independence fostered creativity, problem-solving skills, and the ability to manage risks.

In contrast, today's digital interactions and phone-based childhoods present a stark difference. Many children now spend a significant portion of their time (up to 5-7 hours daily) engaged with social media, short videos, and other digital content. This shift has resulted in less time for unstructured play and real-world social interactions.

The digital environment, while offering its own set of experiences, may not provide the same depth of memory formation or personal growth opportunities. Virtual adventures, such as those in video games, may not create the same lasting, impactful memories as real-world experiences. There's a concern that children today might struggle to form the kind of rich, shared memories that previous generations cherish from their childhoods.

Furthermore, the hyper-structured nature of many children's lives today, with numerous scheduled activities and a focus on academic and career preparation, has reduced the time available for free play and creative exploration. This shift may be impacting children's mental health and overall well-being, as they miss out on crucial developmental experiences that come from unstructured time and face-to-face social interactions.

It's important to note that the nervous system thrives on diverse types of interactions, particularly social ones. The real-world experiences provided by outdoor play and autonomy in childhood offer a richness and variety of stimuli that may be crucial for optimal nervous system development. This suggests that success and healthy development might be more easily achieved by children who engage more fully with the real world, rather than primarily through digital means.

In conclusion, while digital interactions offer their own set of experiences and benefits, they may not fully replicate the developmental advantages and memory-forming potential of the outdoor play and autonomy that characterized childhoods of the past. Balancing digital engagement with real-world experiences and unstructured playtime may be crucial for supporting children's growth, mental health, and formation of lasting memories.

Question: What is meant by the term 'super stimulus' in the context of food and its effects on behavior?

Answer: 

A 'super stimulus' in the context of food refers to highly processed or engineered foods that exaggerate the natural stimuli our brains and bodies have evolved to respond to. These foods are designed to be extremely palatable and rewarding, often combining multiple intense flavors and textures that trigger a stronger response in our reward systems than natural, whole foods.

The concept of super stimulus is closely related to the idea of "hijacking" our evolutionary circuits. Our brains have evolved to seek out energy-rich foods, particularly those high in sugar and fat, as these were rare and valuable in our ancestral environment. However, in our modern food environment, we have access to foods that are far more concentrated in these rewarding elements than anything found in nature.

For example, a cheeseburger with a milkshake that has candy in it is described as a "super duper stimulus." It combines fat, sugar, and even additional sensory stimuli like music and toys, creating what is referred to as a "dopamine bath." This means it triggers a much stronger release of dopamine in our brains than we would typically experience from natural foods.

These super stimuli can have significant effects on our behavior. They can:

1. Override our natural satiety signals, leading to overconsumption
2. Create strong cravings and potentially addictive-like behaviors around certain foods
3. Shift our perception of what foods are rewarding, making less processed foods seem less appealing by comparison
4. Condition our bodies to expect certain metabolic responses, even from artificial versions of these flavors

It's important to note that these super stimuli are not limited to taste alone. The entire eating experience, including smell, texture, and even associated sounds or visuals, can contribute to the overall stimulating effect. This is why food companies often focus on creating "hyper-palatable" foods that engage multiple senses simultaneously.

Understanding the concept of super stimulus in food can help explain why many people struggle with maintaining a healthy diet in the modern food environment, as our brains are constantly being presented with stimuli that are far more intense than what we evolved to handle.

call super foods, only because there are\nample data to support their role in enhancing short\nand long-term cognition, and neuronal health, and so on.', "Again, this is not to take away from some of the beautiful data emphasizing that certain foods, and micronutrients, et cetera, are better for us, or worse\nfor us, and for the planet.\n\nThat's not a debate I want\nto get into right now.\n\nWhat this emphasizes, is that foods impact our\nbrain and its health, but they also impact\nhow our brain functions and responds to food, and that is largely a learned response.\n\nWe can't completely\noverride, for instance, that certain foods evoke a\nstrong, [grunts] yuck component.\n\nCertain foods are truly putrid to us.\n\nI should just say, certain\nthings are putrid to us, and we should not consume them, right?\n\nAt the far end of the spectrum, it's hard-wired for us to avoid those, because they can be dangerous for us.\n\nThey can make us very, very sick.\n\nBut it's also true, that if we continue to eat foods that are progressively sweeter and sweeter and highly palatable, it shifts our dopamine system, because it activates our dopamine system to make us believe that those foods are the only foods that can\ntrigger this reward system, and make us feel good,\nand that they taste good.", "Sugar or sweet tastes, I should\nsay, to be more specific, have an incredibly potent ability to activate dopamine release within the mesolimbic reward pathway.\n\nThis has been shown over\nand over and over again in animal models and in humans.\n\nThis is especially true, I should mention, through the ingestion of sweet liquids.\n\nNow this becomes a very\nimportant point to us a little later on when we\ntalk about the proliferation of sodas and sweet drinks,\nand dare I even say, non-sugar or diet sodas, we're going to get into\nthat a little bit later.\n\nThey are perhaps one of\nthe most third rail topics in nutrition.\n\nBut when we ingest something sweet, the perception of that sweet taste increases dopamine in the\nmesolimbic reward pathways, which then are conveyed to\npathways for motor behavior, and in general, place us\ninto modes of focused action toward getting more of whatever was sweet.\n\nAgain, for those of you\nthat are very disciplined, you can probably eat that\none piece of chocolate and be just fine.", "but then we come to Crave these things because we know what they do to our body we like what they do to our body and that doesn't just make us take them like they're medicine we actually somehow change our very perception of how that flavor is we actually come to savor that flavor we previously found disgusting and it's because our sensation of what is what is whether something's good or bad depends on an internal State and so it's an interesting idea you know perhaps if these Ultra processed foods that have so many different ingredients and such an unnatural combination perhaps this process of learning about the nutrient content of different foods and flavors becomes impaired because it's just the brain is not used the brain's used to saying you know this is a piece of chicken and this is primarily protein and so I can gauge you know from this Flav I can connect this flavor to an amino acid content but something that's so diverse it might be harder to do and isn't it the case that the neurons in the gut and the hormones that are produced by the gut as we digest food and that the neurons in the brain that can control appetite and feeding have to be tuned to macronutrient content because those are the U primary colors of of nutrients and nutrients are uh the way in which we can persist um on a day-to-day basis right I mean I'm not trying to sound more sophisticated where simpler terms would suffice what basically saying is that the neurons in our brains that control these behaviors both eating and cessation of of eating an ingredient or an entire meal can't be tuned to a particular food product or to chicken or to an egg or to a steak uh or to lentils um but rather to amino acid content essential amino acid content in particular essential fatty acids and in the case of carbohydrate whatever is going to replace whatever glycogen we might have depleted right", "So a really good example that\nI think is an exciting one is as it relates to sugar.\n\nSo we all know that sweet\nthings generally tastes good.\n\nI'm not particularly a\nfan of very sweet things.\n\nYou know, I'd much rather have cheese or pizza or hamburger or steak.\n\nI like savory fatty foods, but I do like sweet foods.\n\nAnd most people find sweet\nfoods to be attractive.\n\nThey want them, they might or they might not be able\nto regulate their behavior around them, but they want them.\n\nAnd what's really interesting\nis that for hundreds of years people have thought that that's because of the way that sweet foods taste.\n\nSo that makes sense, right?\n\nYou eat something that tastes sweet.\n\nYou want more of it.\n\nWell, it turns out that it's much more interesting than that.\n\nWhen you eat something sweet within your stomach,\nyou have cells, neurons, that sense the presence of sugary foods independent of their taste\nand signal to the brain.\n\nSo those sensors, those\nneurons send information up the vagus to your brain goes through a series of stations.\n\nAnd then you release dopamine.\n\nThis molecule that makes you want more of whatever it is that you just ingested.", "- But you have to think\nof it not as humans, remember we inherited the\ncircuits of our ancestors and they through evolutionary\nfrom their ancestors.\n\nAnd we haven't had that many years to have fundamentally\nchanged in many of these hardwired circuits.\n\nSo forget as humans, let's look at animals in the wild.\n\nWhich is easier now to\ncomprehend the logic.\n\nYou know, why should this take a long time of continued reinforcement given that I can taste it in a second?\n\nYou want to make sure that this\nsource of sugar, for example, in the wild is the best.\n\nIs the richest.\n\nIt's the one where I get the most energy for the least amount of extraction, the least amount of work.\n\nI want to identify rich sources of sugar.\n\nAnd if the system simply\nresponds immediately to the first sugar that gets to your gut, you're going to form the association with those sources of food, which are not the ones that\nyou should be eating from. -\n\nDon't fall in love with the\nfirst person you encounter.\n\n- Oh my goodness, exactly.\n\nAnd so evolutionarily by\nhaving the taste system, giving you the immediate recognition, but then by forcing this gut brain axis to reinforce it only when sustained repeated exposure has informed the brain.\n\nThis is the one you don't want\nto form the association before.\n\nAnd so when we remove it from the context of we just go to the supermarket, we're not hunting there in\nthe wild where I need to form.\n\nAnd so what's is that\nhighly processed foods are hijacking, co-opting\nthese circuits in a way that it would've never happened in nature.\n\nAnd then we not only find\nthese things appetitive and palatable, but in addition, we are continuously reinforcing, the wanting in a way that,\noh my God, this is so great.\n\nWhat do I feel like eating?\n\nLet me have more of this.", "and then I'm sure you're anticipating what's coming somebody can just hear the buzzer or the Bell can simply ring and that person will experience an increase in insulin so what I'm describing is a conditioned insulin response a stimulus such as a bell or a buzzer that on its own should have zero effect on insulin release has been paired with a food that genuinely increases insulin within the bloodstream and then even if the food isn't present the stimulus the buzzer the Bell Etc can evoke the insulin response now this is an important example to understand because it's a common one that we've presumably all experienced and that exists within the wiring of our brain right now but it's different than the smell evoking the insulin response because delicious food which evokes an insulin response having a particular odor that makes sense in the context of food but here we're talking about something completely unrelated to the food not the odor not the taste not the appearance just something that happened to be in the environment in which you ate the food leading to an increase in insulin and it just screams placebo effect", "Well, there are events that a\nsingle event is so traumatic that it activates the circuits in a way that it's a one trial learning.\n\nAnd the taste system is literally at the top of that food chain.\n\nAnd there is a phenomenon known as conditioned taste aversion.\n\nYou can pair an attractive\nstimuli with a really bad one, and you can make an animal begin to vehemently dislike for example, sugar.\n\nAnd that's because you've\nconditioned the animals to now be averse to these\notherwise nice taste because it's been associated with malaise.\n\nAnd when you do that, now you could begin to ask\nwhy has change in the signal as it travels from the tongue to the brain in a normal animal versus an animal where you\nhave now transformed sweet from being attractive to being immersive.\n\nAnd this is the way now\nyou begin to explore how the brain changes,\nthe nature, the quality, the meaning of a stimuli\nas a function of its state.", "Now, even for people that\nare of healthy weight and who don't have metabolic syndromes, there may be an additional reason to not want to ingest very sweet foods and highly refined sugars.\n\nAnd this has to do with\na new and emerging area of nutrition neuroscience.\n\nAnd I want to point out that\nthese are new data, right, so it's not a lock, the double blind placebo\ncontrolled studies in large populations\nhave not been finished.\n\nSo I want to make sure that that's clear, but I also want to make clear what some of the really exciting data, coming from Dana Small's lab at Yale, and from other laboratories are showing.\n\nAnd this has to do with what's called conditioned taste preference.\n\nUsing a kind of Pavlovian\nparadigm, what they do, is they have people, and these\nstudies were done in people, ingest maltodextrin, which\nincreases blood glucose, doesn't have much flavor, but even if it does have a\nlittle bit of subtle flavor, the maltodextrin is cloaked\nby some other flavor.\n\nAnd by cloaking it with that other flavor or pairing it with that other flavor, what they find is that over time, because the maltodextrin\nincreases blood glucose, and they're ingesting a particular flavor along with that maltodextrin, they can then remove the maltodextrin, and the flavor will induce\nan increase in insulin.\n\nThe increase in insulin of course, is the consequence of\nthe fact that anytime there's a rise in blood glucose, provided the person isn't diabetic, there's a parallel increase in insulin.", "but it's still shunning shaming um self attack and and anxiety depression Etc in boys the neural circuits that we're talking about are are related to sex and violence those evolved over hundreds of thousands not millions of years and those are heightened so we're s capturing the the extremes of these neural circuit functions I'm looking at this through the lens of a neurobiologist this is great and this is where it seems we're running into trouble because the the iceberg below all of that the portion of the iceberg below those those peaks of behavior and interactions like none of that's happening there isn't the um it's all happening faster it's more potent and the consequences are are more severe that's right that's right I think there's a good analogy here to junk food where I've heard junk food or the H you know a cheeseburger described as a super stimulus um and you know ice cream is a super duper stimulus you know it's got fat it's got sugar right and a and a cheeseburger with a milkshake and the milkshake has candy in it yeah ice cream and then you get a toy and they're playing music I mean that's a dopamine bath that's right", "So now, having talked\nabout some of the foods and micronutrients that are\nbeneficial to our immediate and long-term brain health, I'd like to shift gears somewhat, and talk about why it is that we like the foods that we like.\n\nWe've all heard before that we are hardwired to pursue sugar, and to like fatty foods, and that calorie-rich\nfoods are attractive to us for all sorts of reasons, you know, surviving famines,\nand things of that sort.\n\nAnd while that is true, the actual mechanisms that underlie food seeking and food preference are far more interesting than that.\n\nThere are basically three channels in our body and nervous system by which we decide what foods to pursue, how much to eat, and\nwhether or not we will find a particular food attractive, whether or not we will\nwant to consume more of it, whether or not we want to avoid it, or whether or not it's just sort of so-so, what I refer to as the\nyum, yuck, or meh analysis.\n\nAnd indeed, that's what\nour nervous system is doing with respect to food.\n\nIt's trying to figure out whether or not, yum, I want more of this, yuck, I want to avoid this, or meh, it's so-so.", "but that's one idea very interesting I'd love to talk about dopamine sure we hear so much about dopamine being involved in pleasure I like to think I've had at least a small level of impact act in convincing people that it's also involved in perhaps mostly involved in things like motivation different forms of learning and lots of other things too folks dopamine does lots of things it's even expressed in the eye and controls adaptation to light so does lots of things but it certainly is believed that dopamine is involved in our either craving for food or pleasure from food what's the real story on dopamine as it relates to food and eating Behavior you had a beautiful paper publish in nature entitled and we'll put a link to this in the show note captions uh dopamine subsystems that track internal States um and I love this paper for a variety of reasons but if you could give us the high points of of your discoveries on dopamine as it relates to feeding I think um I know in fact that people would find it very Illuminating sure fantastic um so uh", "Now this is very interesting\nbecause what it says is, well at a first pass, it says\nthat we are very Pavlovian in terms of our physiological\nresponses to foods and particular flavors\ncome to be associated with particular patterns\nof blood glucose increase and hence patterns of insulin increase, because of course, insulin manages glucose in the bloodstream as I mentioned earlier.\n\nThis also has implications\nfor understanding things like artificial sweeteners.\n\nAnd here I want to\nhighlight that this is still very controversial work, needs\nmore data, but nonetheless, I'd like to share it with\nyou for consideration.\n\nThe small laboratory has\ndone studies in humans, both in adults and in children, showing that if the flavor\nof artificial sweeteners is paired with maltodextrin, and then the maltodextrin is removed, that the artificial sweetener taste itself can subsequently increase\ninsulin in the bloodstream.\n\nIn other words, taking something\nthat increases blood sugar, attaching a flavor experience to that, having children or\nadults ingest that thing, allows the nervous system\nto associate that flavor with that increase in blood glucose.\n\nBut then you can remove the\nglucose increasing substance, and the flavor alone will increase insulin because insulin typically\nfollows blood glucose.\n\nSo this is a conditioning effect.", "But after consuming foods\nthat perhaps are less sweet or even less savory, that are not what we would call highly, or I would say, nowadays,\nit's super palatable foods, we can adjust our sense literally of what we perceive as an\nattractive and rewarding food, and indeed, the dopamine system will reward those foods accordingly.\n\nI can't emphasize enough how much this learning\nof associated food reward is important for not just understanding why we like the foods that we eat, and how to eat more of foods\nthat are healthy for us, and enjoy them, but it also speaks to the fact\nthat our brain, as a whole, is a perceptual device\ntrying to make guesses or estimations about what certain foods are going to do for us.\n\nSo put simply, we don't just like sweet\nfoods because they taste good, we like them because they predict a certain kind of metabolic response.", 'So, Dr. Halpern pointed\nout that you actually have an accelerator that\nincreases your level of awareness and anxiety and sort of constricts your field of\nview and all your senses.\n\nAnytime you interact\nwith food and is driving a primitive reflex to ingest\nas much food as you can, as quickly as you can, and then move on from there, and presumably to do the same elsewhere.\n\nSo, that changed the way that\nI think about eating behavior and eating disorders.\n\nIn fact, we could think about\neating disorders like bulimia as an unmasking of that mechanism without the so-called top-down control, without the mechanisms that we\nuse to regulate our behavior.\n\nAnd indeed bulimia and\nbinge-eating disorder are closely associated with impulsivity and with impulsive\nbehaviors of other kinds, something that we also will discuss more.', "In previous episodes, I've highlighted that\nartificial sweeteners have been shown in studies of animals, that when given in very high\ndoses, sucralose in particular, there can be fairly robust\ndisruption to the gut microbiome, which is vital for immune\nhealth and brain health, et cetera, et cetera.\n\nBut thus far, our knowledge\nof how artificial sweeteners negatively impacts or positively\nimpacts, I should say, the microbiome and other\ndeleterious effects on the body, has mainly been explored\nin animal studies.\n\nAgain, the work by Dana Small\nhas been done in humans.\n\nThere's some parallel work\nby others in animal models.\n\nI bring it up today to\nillustrate the following point.\n\nNormally we have a pathway that we don't have to condition at all, it's there from birth, whereby ingestion of sweet foods causes increases in dopamine.\n\nAnd there are parallel pathways\nby which neurons in our gut and elsewhere in our body, trigger further increases in dopamine.\n\nThere's no need for a conditioned response or to become Pavlovian about this, right?\n\nYou're hardwired to want\nto eat sweet things, by at least two and probably\nthree parallel pathways.\n\nNow the work from Dana\nSmall's lab and others that have illustrated this\nconditioned flavor preference, I think beautifully show that any flavor that's associated with a glucose spike or a long sustained increase in glucose can also be conditioned.\n\nIn other words, the circuits for dopamine that reinforce the desire\nto eat particular things is not unique to the sugar pathway."]

Ground Truths: ["In the context of food and its effects on behavior, the term 'super stimulus' refers to food items that are designed to be excessively appealing, such as junk food, which can trigger heightened responses in the brain's reward system. For example, a cheeseburger or ice cream can be considered super stimuli because they contain high levels of fat and sugar, leading to a strong dopamine response, akin to a 'dopamine bath.'"]
