            <thinking>
                To answer this question, I'll need to:
                1. Identify if the context provides information on maximizing plasticity after entering a state of self-directed adapted plasticity.
                2. Look for specific techniques or methods mentioned that can enhance plasticity.
                3. Consider any limitations or caveats mentioned about maximizing plasticity.
                4. Organize the information into a coherent response.
                5. Identify which video sources were most relevant to the answer.
                </thinking>

                Once your brain enters a state of self-directed adapted plasticity, there are several ways to maximize plasticity:

                1. Focused, dedicated attention: Engage in intense focus on the skill or knowledge you're trying to learn. This triggers chemical and electrical processes in the brain associated with plasticity.

                2. Embrace discomfort: The agitation and frustration you might feel during learning are actually signs that your brain is changing. These feelings are associated with the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine, which signal to your neurons that change is needed.

                3. Repetition and practice: Engage in repeated practice of the skill you're trying to learn. This type of plasticity involves doing seemingly mundane things over and over again.

                4. Incorporate rewards: Engage the dopamine system by incorporating rewards into your learning process. This can help reinforce the neural changes.

                5. Use non-sleep deep rest: After a learning session, engage in deliberate disengagement such as walking, running, or sitting quietly. This has been shown in studies to accelerate the rate of plasticity.

                6. Ensure quality deep sleep: Deep sleep is crucial for consolidating learning and promoting plasticity.

                7. Expand your comfort zone: If you're already engaging in regular play or learning activities, try to expand into new forms. For example, if you typically engage in solo activities, try group activities to challenge your brain in new ways.

                It's important to note that plasticity itself is not the goal, but rather a means to achieve specific learning or behavioral changes. Always keep in mind what particular aspect of your nervous system you're trying to change and structure your approach accordingly.

    "answer": """Childhood neglect can have significant and lasting impacts on individuals in adulthood. Based on the information provided in the Huberman Lab podcast discussions, here are some key ways childhood neglect affects adults:

1. Attachment styles: Childhood neglect strongly influences adult attachment patterns in relationships. The neural circuits that govern infant-caregiver bonds are repurposed for adult romantic attachments. This means that people who experienced neglect as children may struggle to form secure, healthy attachments in their adult relationships.

2. Emotional regulation: Neglect can impair the development of emotional regulation skills. Adults who were neglected as children may have difficulty managing their emotions effectively, leading to challenges in relationships and overall mental health.

3. Self-worth and shame: Childhood neglect often triggers deep-seated feelings of shame and inadequacy that persist into adulthood. Many adults who experienced neglect struggle with low self-esteem and a pervasive sense of not being "good enough."

4. Trauma responses: Neglect is a form of childhood trauma that can have long-lasting effects on the brain and body. Adults with histories of neglect may experience heightened stress responses, hypervigilance, or other trauma-related symptoms.

5. Cognitive impacts: Severe neglect can affect brain development, potentially leading to cognitive challenges or differences in adulthood.

6. Relationship patterns: Adults who experienced childhood neglect may unconsciously recreate dysfunctional relationship patterns or struggle to maintain healthy boundaries in their adult relationships.

7. Mental health vulnerabilities: Childhood neglect increases the risk of developing various mental health issues in adulthood, including depression, anxiety, and personality disorders.

However, it's important to note that the effects of childhood neglect are not necessarily permanent or deterministic. The brain remains plastic throughout life, meaning that healing and change are possible. Therapy, supportive relationships, and intentional work on attachment and emotional regulation can help adults overcome the impacts of childhood neglect.

The podcast discussions emphasize that while early experiences shape us, they don't define us entirely. With understanding and appropriate interventions, adults can rewire their neural circuits, develop more secure attachment styles, and improve their overall mental health and relationship functioning.
