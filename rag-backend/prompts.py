            Analyze the following user query and determine if it would benefit from multi-query generation.
            Consider the following factors:
            1. Vagueness: Is the query too broad or unclear?
            2. Complexity: Does the query involve multiple concepts or require a nuanced understanding?
            3. Ambiguity: Could the query be interpreted in multiple ways?
            4. Lack of context: Is there missing information that could lead to multiple interpretations?
