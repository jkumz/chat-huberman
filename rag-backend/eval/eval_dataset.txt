Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll focus on the following key points from the context:
1. The importance of experiences over deprivation in child development
2. The role of positive experiences in shaping neural circuits and behavior
3. The impact of play and unstructured time on child development
4. The significance of emotional regulation and social interactions

I'll structure the answer to highlight these aspects and their significance for children's development.
</thinking>

Prioritizing experiences over deprivation is crucial for children's development as it shapes their neural circuits, emotional regulation, and social skills in significant ways.

Firstly, providing children with a variety of positive experiences helps strengthen neural pathways that support healthy development. As mentioned in the context, when children have strongly reinforcing experiences, the neural circuits associated with those behaviors are strengthened, making it easier for them to repeat those behaviors in the future. This process is largely driven by dopamine and acetylcholine, which play key roles in learning and plasticity.

Secondly, prioritizing experiences allows children to develop emotional regulation skills. By engaging children in activities that excite them and also provide immediate pleasure, parents can help balance the dopaminergic (anticipation) and serotonergic (contentment) systems. This balance is essential for healthy adult relationships and emotion regulation later in life.

Thirdly, providing diverse experiences, especially through play and unstructured time, is vital for children's social and cognitive development. Unstructured play time allows children to explore, be creative, reflect, and interact with peers in ways that are crucial for their mental health and wellbeing. These experiences help children develop social skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity.

Lastly, prioritizing experiences over deprivation helps children develop a healthy mindset about various aspects of life. For example, exposing children to positive experiences with healthy foods can help them develop a mindset that "healthy foods are indulgent and delicious," rather than viewing them as a chore.

In contrast, environments of deprivation or neglect can have negative impacts on development. Studies on enriched environments for animals have shown that providing varied experiences and stimuli leads to better brain development compared to deprived conditions.

It's important to note that while early experiences are crucial, development is a lifelong process. Even if a child has experienced trauma or stress, which can make it harder to engage in play or access neuroplasticity, these effects are not permanent and can be overcome with appropriate interventions and experiences later in life.

Retrieved Contexts: ['So this is actually really\nimportant to understand that a baby, when you were a\nbaby, and when I was a baby, we didn\'t have any sense\nof the outside world except that it responded to our\nacts of anxiety essentially.\n\nNow this isn\'t Freudian theory, There are components of it that are embedded in Freudian theory, but all developmental\npsychologists agree that babies lack the ability to make cognitive sense\nof the outside world, but in this feeling of anxiety and registering one\'s own internal state, and then crying out to the outside world, either through crying\nor subtle vocalizations, or even just cuing, making some noise, we start to develop a relationship\nwith the outside world in which our internal states, our shifts and anxiety\nstart to drive requests, and people come and respond\nto those requests, hopefully.\n\nAnd the reason I say hopefully is that we\'ve all heard presumably about these cases of neglect.\n\nThere are a lot of cases\nwhere if you neglect a baby, you neglect an adolescent or a teenager, development doesn\'t go well, and we\'ll touch on some of those.\n\nBut those are really extreme cases.\n\nThey\'re sort of like the\nparallel to experiments that are often done in the\nlaboratory with animals, where you\'ve probably heard\nof these enriched environments where they\'ll give mice a bunch of toys, and they\'ll give them some different foods\nevery once in a while, and they\'ll house them\ntogether with other mice.\n\nAnd then what you find\nis that the animals, they will say, "Oh, their brain is thicker and their neurons have more\nbranches to them and all that."', 'But that\'s really comparing\ndeprivation with normalcy.\n\nWhat we want to center on today instead is what happens when things go well, and why things might not go well in certain circumstances is interesting.\n\nBut to me, not as interesting as what healthy emotional\ndevelopment looks like.\n\nAnd if you haven\'t achieved\nhealthy emotional development, what can be done as an intervention at later times in order to rescue that?\n\nSo the baby, you as a baby, you\'re flopping around there in your crib, you\'re getting care where you need it and when you need it, presumably, and this gets to the basis\nof what emotions are about, which are emotions are\nreally about forming bonds and being able to predict\nthings in the world.\n\nThat\'s really what emotions are about.\n\nWhether or not the baby\nfeels angry or happy or sad, we don\'t know, we can\nguess, but we don\'t know.\n\nIn fact, most of the time we\ndon\'t even know how we feel, let alone how other people feel, and that\'s true for adults.\n\nSo if I asked you how you feel right now, I don\'t know that you could tell me in any kind of rich\nlanguage that I would say, "Oh I really understand."', "- Your child real, real child.\n\nThe real kind of experiment.\n\n- It's how do I resist the urge to force my child to eat her dinner so that she can have her dessert, right?\n\nBecause that's the real urge.\n\nIt's like, no, you need\n- Or you're negotiating.\n\n- to do that.\n\nBecause when you start thinking about it in terms of mindset, you realize, oh, that's just reinforcing to her, that the dessert is the\nexciting, fun thing to have.\n\nAnd this thing that I have\nto do must be horrible.\n\nSo horrible that my parent is\nforcing me to do it, right?\n\nSo it's letting go a\nlittle bit of the behavior, the objective reality, and really thinking about\nthe subjective reality and focusing on adaptive mindsets.\n\nSo my goal as a parent has been to try to help her\ninstill a healthy mindset about eating, that healthy foods are\nindulgent and delicious.\n\nThat the experience of\nstress is inevitable, that it's natural.\n\nAnd that going through\nstressful experience can help her learn, grow, and become a more connected\nand happier individual.\n\nAnd with exercise and physical activity, we haven't really gotten to that yet, but [laughs] we will with time.", "yeah so I think it's it's really I mean I'm I'm so I'm a parent I have two kids that are in public school and I think their Public Schools rated you know it's fine Buton say it's all right and um but but at their school they definitely do get education about um more holistic health and emotional regulation I think and and considering others um that's been that's that's a big focus of the school and I think that's actually really important I I I I mean you know again I'm I'm super biased from from my upbringing but my kids are going to learn math whenever it's time to learn the that they'll learn it whenever they need it you know whenever they need it they're going to learn it in a couple I don't know a couple weeks and figure out do the thing um most of the things that they learn they're going to forget them and then have to relearn them um so what are the things that you're going to really need to know no matter what you choose to do and I think regulating your your own emotions and and and engaging other individuals in a healthy sustainable way that you know and I mean sustainable in terms of the longevity of their relationships and I think those are the things that end up really mattering so I think um also this question about exposure to abundance and scarcity uh is really interesting too I mean I don't know if that's a direction we want to go into so please yeah well I think you know this whole you know it sort sounds sort of new Agy when I say you know abundant the abundance mindset", "Leveraging different kinds\nof social relationships that reinforce positive behavior.\n\nThis is starting to sound like\nkind of a boiler plate stuff.\n\nAnd yet, really the goal is during puberty to encourage as many\nsafe forms of interaction that allow children, teens,\nreally and adolescents, I keep calling them children, but what I mean are children\ngoing through puberty, that allow them to test\nthis thing of autonomy so that they can start\nto make good assessments about their exteroceptive\nevents that they are selecting and how those make them feel internally.\n\nSo they're essentially doing a buffet.\n\nThe buffet has now broadened to not just include the\nevents and experiences that their parents and\nother caretakers bring them, but they can now expand the buffet into things that they\ncan provide themselves.\n\nAnd so adolescence and puberty is really seen as the\nperiod of development in which one self-samples\nfor these two elements that we talked about at\nthe beginning, which are, how do I form bonds and how do I make predictions about what will make me feel good at a level of interoception.", "It's very apparent that\nhealthy social bonding between children and caretaker relies on the fact that\nboth this right brain system and the left brain system are engaged, that there's a synchronization\nof autonomic function, meaning a joining together\nin actual somatic feeling, and that there's a\nsynchronization of experience that's more about some\noutward or external stimulus, like reading a book or\nwatching a show together or enjoying some common\nexperience of a meal together.\n\nAnd of course, as children get older, they're able to access\nmore and more cognitively sophisticated things.\n\nYou can watch a movie with them and they'll make predictions\nabout which characters are going to show up for instance, or you can take to a concert and they can appreciate the\nconcert or play in that concert, and they appreciate that\nthey're being appreciated.", '- It reminds me, as a neurobiologist, was weaned in the landscape\nof so-called critical periods, where early life environment\nvery strongly shapes the brain.\n\nAnd so many studies were\ndone on animals raised in traditional cages with a\nwater bottle and some food, maybe a few other animals\nof the same species.\n\nAnd then people came along and said, wait, normally these species in\nthe wild would have things like things to climb over\nand things to go through, and you provide those very basic elements, and all of a sudden the\narchitecture of neural circuits looks very different, and you realize that were studying a deprived condition.', "One of my favorite things\nabout developmental biology and developmental psychology is that it is grounded in the fact that we don't just have a\nchildhood and an adulthood.\n\nThere isn't just our child\nself and our adult self.\n\nAnd even though there\nare transitions around the mechanisms that\nunderline neuroplasticity at approximately age 25, it is simply the case that development is our entire lifespan, that our lifespan is one\nlong developmental arc.\n\nHow long depends on our\ngenetics, our lifestyle accidents, injury and disease of course, but it is one long developmental arc.\n\nAnd so it shouldn't surprise us at all that how we learn to play as\na 10 year old or 12 year old would impact how we play\nand interact with people as a teenager and a young adult and on and on and on.\n\nAnd that play is the\nplace in which we explore in which we learn play is the substrate by which our nervous system changes us from this hyper-connected\nbatch of neurons, where everything is\nconnected to everything, more or less to a brain and nervous system whereby certain circuits work\nwith immense proficiency and others are less accessible to us.", "And there's a beautiful model of emotional development\nthat was developed by Alan shore professor at UCLA and psychiatrist that

positive anticipation.", "but I worry that right now that we've almost somehow made that kind of unstructured time seem inefficient you know we've set these standards uh for our kids that they need to be uh you know getting fancy jobs and into fancy colleges and making an x amount of money and the path to doing that is you know to be enrolled in X number of activities after school and to do all this stuff in school and their lives are so hyper structured um that I worry that the time to just play to be creative to reflect and think to just have unstructured time with other kids has evaporated and I think that that also is hurting the mental health and wellbeing of our children I love the idea that that unstructured play time could be framed in the accurate context of the nervous system developing the way it was supposed to develop I mean I would argue that um success is going to be easiest for children that engage in the real world more in fact there's great risk to posting everything that you do online we've seen some examples of that preventing people from getting into or staying in college based on things they said or did previously that they shouldn't have said or done um that's those are kind of you know negative highlighted cases but in general um we know that the the nervous system thrives on diversity of types of interactions and social interactions in particular I'm just restating what you just said", "oh my goodness there's there's abundance here of something oh time to learn something new that's right we've we've overemphasized the extent to which plasticity is driven by punishment but the the neuromodulators that allow for plasticity in particular in puberty and as adults are largely dopamine dependent and acetylcholine dependent um the acetylcholine generally increases Focus um broadly speaking I mean does a bunch of other things controls muscular contraction Etc but so what we're basically saying here is that if a kid gets a strongly reinforcing experience I I'd be willing to bet both arms that the neural circuits that help generate whatever behaviors led to that experience are going to be strengthened in one trial to the extent that it will be very easy to generate those those behaviors again okay so this okay thank you this is exactly what I wanted to know to to deepen my the theorizing that I do in the book um so now this is actually the perfect time for us to switch over to the four recommendation the four main recommendations because they build exactly on what you just said they help me explain why this is so important so um so you know I think one one reason why the book seems to be doing very well and people seem to like and pass it on is that it's not just Doom and Gloom it's not just oh we've messed up our kids", "Now, one of the key findings that\nhas emerged from the literature is children that have\nbeen subjected to trauma or immense amounts of stress of any kind, have a harder time both engaging in play, but also a harder time\naccessing neuroplasticity later in life.\n\nThe good news is this is\nnot a permanent effect.\n\nAnd we'll talk about some\nof the ways to overcome that in a moment, but this should make sense to you because earlier we talked about how a high level of adrenaline epinephrine in the brain and body actually inhibits blocks the circuits in the brain and body that\ngenerate play behavior.\n\nAnd when I say that, I mean that in a very concrete way, that epinephrine and adrenaline can actually suppress\nthe sorts of circuitry that can lead to things like soft eyes or tongue out, or the head tilt, or what we called partial postures of being able to engage in, you know, a rough and tumble play, but not take that to the\npoint of outright aggression and damaging the other\nperson or them damaging you."]

Ground Truths: ["Prioritizing experiences over deprivation is significant for children's development as it fosters trust in kids to sort things out and be safe. Statistics suggest that children are more likely to thrive under conditions that allow for experiences rather than facing deprivation, which can lead to a more positive development environment."]

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll focus on the information provided about high-risk environments, particularly the example of Navy SEAL teams. I'll explain what it means for team members to be relentlessly hard on each other in these contexts, emphasizing the purpose and benefits of this approach. I'll also contrast this with toxic environments to highlight the difference.
</thinking>

In high-risk environments, such as Navy SEAL teams, being "relentlessly hard on each other" refers to a practice of constant, rigorous evaluation and feedback among team members. This approach serves several important purposes:

1. Maintaining high standards: By consistently challenging each other, team members ensure that everyone performs at their best. This is crucial in high-stakes situations where mistakes can have severe consequences.

2. Building resilience: The constant pressure helps team members develop mental toughness and the ability to perform under stress.

3. Fostering trust and respect: Paradoxically, this seemingly harsh treatment can lead to stronger bonds between team members. As one example mentions, "athletes often are very good friends and some of the people they respect the most are the folks who they're battling."

4. Promoting growth: By identifying and addressing weaknesses, team members help each other improve continuously.

5. Ensuring safety: In high-risk environments, being critical of each other's performance can be a matter of life and death.

It's important to note that this approach is different from toxic or destructive criticism. In healthy high-performance teams, the hard treatment is task-oriented and aimed at improvement, not personal attacks. As one source mentions, there's "a huge difference between competition that's oriented on tasks which can help us be the best version of ourselves and competition that bleeds into judgment suspicion and mistrust."

This relentless approach is often coupled with strong bonds of trust and loyalty. As Jocko Willink points out, a team that has strong relationships and mutual care will outperform a team where members dislike each other, even if they're equally skilled.

In summary, being relentlessly hard on each other in high-risk environments is a deliberate strategy to maintain peak performance, build resilience, and ensure safety, while paradoxically strengthening team bonds and mutual respect.

this is what's known as stack ranking and um you know this is where people managers are forced to pick the highest performing and lowest performing members of their team and in essence eliminate the people who are at the bottom 10% every six or 12 months stack ranking has thankfully mostly fallen out of favor in in the corporate world but it was very uh Durer um in the late 20th and early 21st century you know up until 10 or so years ago and it still exists in some places and the idea again was if you want people to be creative if you want them to do their best tap into who they really are and who are we really we are really a hyper individualistic again Darwin species it's really stack ranking is a social darwinist approach to management and the idea is well great if you threaten

Ground Truths: ["In high-risk environments, being relentlessly hard on each other means that team members maintain a high level of accountability and rigor, often using humor as a way to cope with the stress. This approach fosters a culture where individuals push each other to perform at their best, recognizing the high stakes involved. It creates an environment of trust and reliance on each other's skills, allowing team members to step up when needed while also being able to rest when others take the lead."]

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll focus on the neurobiological perspective of heightened behaviors and interactions related to neural circuits. I'll draw from the context that discusses:
1. Pro-social circuits and their activation
2. The concept of neural circuits as collections of brain areas working together
3. The role of specific brain areas like the nucleus accumbens in social behavior
4. The interaction between different neural circuits for various behaviors
5. The plasticity and adaptability of these circuits
</thinking>

From a neurobiological perspective, heightened behaviors and interactions related to neural circuits can be understood as the result of increased activation and connectivity between specific brain areas. 

Neurobiologists view these behaviors through the lens of "pro-social circuits" in the brain. When these circuits are activated, there's an increase in neuronal firing, which can be observed through neuroimaging as a "lighting up" of certain brain areas. This heightened activity is analogous to "turning up the volume" on these neural circuits.

Interestingly, when pro-social circuits are more active, they tend to inhibit circuits associated with aversive or defensive behaviors. This creates a kind of "seesaw" effect in the brain, where increased activity in one set of circuits can lead to decreased activity in another.

These neural circuits are not isolated to individual brain areas but involve collections of brain regions working together to engage patterns of behaviors. For instance, the nucleus accumbens and its associated circuitry play a crucial role in decision-making processes related to social interactions, influencing which behaviors we choose to pursue or avoid.

Neurobiologists also emphasize that these circuits are highly plastic and adaptable. The neural circuitry involved in social behaviors seems particularly amenable to behavioral plasticity, meaning it can change and adapt based on experiences and environmental factors.

Moreover, these circuits don't operate in isolation but interact with various neurotransmitter systems. Dopamine and serotonin, for example, are thought to modulate the activity of these circuits, influencing our social behaviors and interactions.

It's important to note that while we have a general understanding of these processes, many of the specific mechanisms are still being researched. As one neuroscientist in the context admitted, while we know many of the connections and brain areas involved, providing a coherent hypothesis or diagram of how it all happens remains a challenge in the field.

to come up with better ones, is what I alluded\nto earlier, is that it was very adaptive when we were more primitive organisms,\nnever mind non human primates, but when we were whatever we were, to be a social\nspecies for basically primarily two reasons, for reproductive purposes, it\nincreased your likelihood of reproducing if you were hanging out with other members of your species in a non aggressive way and for protection against predators.\n\nAnd there may be other reasons, probably.", "Andrew Huberman: So, in thinking about\nsocial interactions and leaving aside anything related to autism, for the\nmoment, it appears that the circuits in the brain that mediate the desire to spend\ntime with others of the same species, maybe even with other species like a\ndog, are fairly hardwired but modifiable.\n\nWe were born with the capacity\nto build them up and that social behavior is highly rewarded.\n\nIs it rewarded through\nthe dopamine system?\n\nAnd what, if any, involvement is\nthere of the serotonergic system?\n\nAnd we haven't talked about\nserotonin yet, but I'd love to bring up serotonin at this point.\n\nMaybe you could educate us a little\nbit about

oxytocin, and that collaborate with\nthe autonomic nervous system to drive what we call\ndesire, love and attachment.\n\nAnd the three circuits are\nautonomic nervous system, we talked about that one.\n\nThen there's the nervous system components or the neural circuits for\nempathy, for being able to see and respond to indeed\nmatch the emotional tone or the autonomic tone of another.\n\nAnd then there's the third category, and this might surprise some of you, it certainly surprised me, but the data point to the fact\nthat the third neural circuit that's very important\nfor establishing

about\nthose neural circuits and what they are.\n\nNow, often when we hear empathy, we think, oh, empathy is really about\nlistening to and really understanding what\nsomebody else is

Andrew Huberman: You're still going.", "- Right, that is a central question.\n\nI can say, at least with\nrespect to the fear neurons that sit on top of the aggression neurons, we know that when those neurons are activated optogenetically, in the same way we would\nactivate the aggression neurons, that there's clearly an arousal\nprocess that's occurring, you can see the pupils\ndilate in the animal.\n\nThere is an increase in stress hormone release\ninto the bloodstream, we've shown that heart rate goes up.\n\nSo in addition to the\ndrive to actually freeze, which is what those animals do, there is autonomic arousal and neuroendocrine activation\nof stress responses.\n\nAnd some of that is probably shared by the aggression neurons\nand the mating neurons, although we haven't investigated\nit in as much detail, but I wouldn't be surprised because they project to\nmany of the same regions that the fear neurons project to, which is a interesting issue in the context to discuss later maybe, in the context of why we're comfortable with mental illnesses that are based on maladaptations of fear,\nbut not mental illnesses that are based on\nmaladaptations of aggression

electrical\nstimulation in an experiment, believe it or not, that's been done in\nboth animals and humans, animals and humans become\nvery, very motivated to get more stimulation of these pathways.\n\nSo this pleasure pathway or\nthese circuits for pleasure are very what we call reinforcing.\n\nIn fact, animals and humans will work hard to get stimulation of these brain areas even more than they will\nwork to obtain sex, drugs, or even if they are addicted\nto a particular drug and they are in a state of withdrawal, the ultimate state of craving, if given a choice, a person or an animal will select to have stimulation\nof this pleasure pathway instead of the drug itself.\n\nAnd that is a major and\nsignificant finding.", "Andrew Huberman: So using that as a\nframework to think about social behavior, as you said, pro social, non aggressive,\nnon sexual interactions involve the choice of a lot of behaviors, but also\nthe suppression of a lot of behaviors.\n\nMaybe you're starting to\nsense what I'm doing here.\n\nI think for people to understand how a\nsingle structure like the accumbens could mediate social interaction and reward\nit, what it sounds like it's doing is rewarding a certain category and catalog\nof behavioral options and punishing, or at least reducing the probability of the\noccurrence of other behavioral actions.\n\nBecause when I go to dinner\nwith friends, if I know them really well, I might hug them.\n\nI might even say something\nmildly inappropriate if I know the context to be safe, right?\n\nBut at a dinner interview or a

really broad\nintegration and testing.\n\nI think this is the key element here, testing of circuits\nfor emotions and reward as they relate to decisions.\n\nAnd I think that's useful because when you look at the behavior\nof adolescents and teens, they are testing social interactions, they are testing physical\ninteractions with the world.\n\nOftentimes they're engaging\nin unsafe behavior.\n\nI would never try and justify that with the underlying neurology, but the neuroscience points\nto increased connectivity between areas of the brain that\nare related to emotionality and to threat

human brain imaging studies suggest is\nactivated during empathic human responses.\n\nAnd the projections of that\narea into the nucleus accumbens.\n\nThat\'s the connection.\n\nAnd we\'re interested in whether\nneuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin may influence this circuitry,\nthese connections that are involved in these "empathic" behaviors, etc. , etc .\n\nAnd we think drugs can be\nused as probes of those kinds of neuromodulatory mechanisms.\n\nI hope this is all making sense.', "Today's discussion explores all of\nthese topics, and by the end of today's discussion, you will have a rich\nunderstanding of how neurochemicals like dopamine and serotonin work in parallel,\nto reinforce that is, to increase the probability that we will engage in\ncertain types of thinking and

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll need to:
1. Identify key differences between social media addiction and traditional substance addictions like tobacco from the context
2. Focus on the social aspects of social media addiction
3. Highlight the differences in biological vs. social addiction mechanisms
4. Mention the differences in addiction patterns and prevalence
5. Note any similarities or overlaps between the two types of addiction
</thinking>

Social media addiction differs from traditional substance addictions like tobacco in several key ways:

1. Addiction mechanism: Social media addiction is primarily a social addiction, rather than a biochemical addiction. Unlike tobacco, which is biologically addictive due to nicotine, social media doesn't have a specific chemical compound causing physical dependence. Instead, it operates on social and psychological levels.

2. Prevalence and spread: Social media addiction tends to be more widespread and can affect entire populations rapidly. As Dr. Jonathan Haidt points out, with tobacco, even at its peak, only about 37% of American high school students smoked. In contrast, social media adoption is often an all-or-nothing phenomenon, especially among younger populations. It's either "none or everybody," and it typically happens as early as middle school.

3. Accessibility and integration: Social media is deeply integrated into daily life and is much more accessible than substances like tobacco. It's constantly available through smartphones and other devices, making it easier to develop compulsive behaviors.

4. Feedback mechanisms: Social media provides immediate feedback and rewards through likes, comments, and notifications. This instant gratification can activate reward circuits in the brain, albeit not as intensely as drugs like cocaine or opioids.

5. Perception of harm: There's often less awareness of the addictive potential of social media compared to well-known substance addictions. As Dr. Anna Lembke notes, people getting addicted to social media often don't realize it's happening until after the fact.

6. Withdrawal and quitting: While both types of addiction can be difficult to overcome, the nature of withdrawal differs. Tobacco addiction involves physical withdrawal symptoms, whereas social media addiction withdrawal is more psychological and social in nature.

However, it's important to note that there are some similarities. Both can lead to compulsive behaviors, and both can activate reward circuits in the brain. Dr. Robert Malenka describes how checking messages on his phone has a "compulsive, addictive quality" similar to a lever press for a mouse in an experiment.

In conclusion, while both social media and tobacco can be addictive, the mechanisms, patterns, and societal impacts of these addictions are quite distinct, with social media addiction being more of a social and psychological phenomenon compared to the primarily biological addiction of tobacco.

Ground Truths: ["Social media addiction is distinguished from traditional substance addictions like tobacco in that it is a social addiction rather than a biological one. Unlike tobacco, which is biologically addictive and can lead to a significant percentage of a population being addicted, social media addiction affects everyone, particularly in middle school, and cannot have just a third of users addicted; it's either none or everybody."]

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll need to analyze the provided context for information on:
1. How gambling affects loneliness and emotions
2. How social media affects loneliness and emotions
3. Any comparisons or connections between gambling and social media effects
4. Specific emotional and social impacts mentioned

I'll structure the answer to address both gambling and social media, their effects on loneliness and emotions, and draw connections where possible.
</thinking>

Gambling and social media can both have significant impacts on loneliness and emotions, often in ways that are interconnected and potentially harmful.

Gambling, particularly when it becomes addictive, can lead to intense emotional experiences. For some individuals, gambling becomes a form of self-medication. As described by Dr. Jonathan Haidt, a gambling addict may feel terrible about their life choices and the consequences of their addiction, but they continue to gamble because it provides a temporary escape. The gambler experiences a brief period of feeling good while engaged in the activity, despite the overall negative impact on their life. This cycle can perpetuate feelings of shame and isolation, potentially exacerbating loneliness.

Social media, while different in nature, can have similarly complex effects on emotions and social connections. Dr. Vivek Murthy, the U.S. Surgeon General, points out that while social media has increased our ability to communicate, it has paradoxically led to increased loneliness and decreased understanding between people. Young people, in particular, report that social media often makes them feel worse about themselves and their friendships. The constant comparison to others online can erode self-esteem, which in turn makes it harder to form genuine connections in real life.

Both gambling and social media appear to tap into the brain's reward circuits, potentially leading to addictive behaviors. Dr. Robert Malenka suggests that social media platforms have likely capitalized on the same reward mechanisms in the brain that are activated by in-person social interactions, albeit potentially less intensely. This can create a cycle where individuals turn to these platforms for social connection or emotional regulation, even when the experience is ultimately unsatisfying or harmful.

Dr. Kay Tye hypothesizes that social media interactions may not be as effective in combating loneliness as real-time, synchronous interactions. The asynchronous nature of most social media communication lacks the interbrain synchrony that occurs during in-person interactions, which may be crucial for meaningful social contact.

For both gambling and social media, there's a risk of these activities becoming compulsive behaviors that individuals turn to when feeling lonely or anxious. Dr. Haidt notes that as young people have moved their social lives online, many have become lonelier, seeking "cheap and easy stimulation" that ultimately doesn't satisfy their social needs.

In conclusion, while gambling and social media operate through different mechanisms, both can significantly impact emotions and contribute to feelings of loneliness. They can create cycles of temporary relief followed by increased negative emotions, potentially leading to addiction-like behaviors. The key difference seems to be that while gambling is more clearly recognized as potentially harmful, social media's effects are more pervasive and sometimes less obvious, affecting how people, especially young individuals, perceive themselves and interact with others.

and I think frankly for many older people too is their experience on social media has shredded their self-esteem as they constantly comparing themselves to other people like when you and I were growing up uh you know in the ' 80s we we compared ourselves to other people too right people have from Millennia but what's fundamentally different now is that in a given day you can compare yourself to thousands of images that you see online that's actually literally what people young people tell me I do roundtables with college students and high school students all the time around the country

is a great masquerader it can look like withdrawal and sadness it can look like anger and irritability it can look like aloofness as well and so it's only when we stop to ask someone how they're doing

Ground Truths: ['Gambling and social media can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and negative emotions. For gamblers, the addiction can lead to a cycle of shame and despair, as they believe that the next gamble could change everything, which creates a false sense of hope. Similarly, when individuals, particularly boys and girls, shift their social lives to video games, porn, and social media, they may experience loneliness despite receiving cheap and easy stimulation, which ultimately is not satisfying.']

Answer: <thinking>
The question asks about laws protecting against child neglect claims for unsupervised outdoor play. I'll need to analyze the context for any mention of such laws, focusing on the parts that discuss legal protections for allowing children to play independently. The most relevant information appears to be in the first document, which mentions an organization called "Let Grow" and their efforts to pass laws in several states.
</thinking>

There are laws in place in some states that protect parents from child neglect claims when they allow their children to engage in unsupervised outdoor play. An organization called Let Grow, co-founded by Jonathan Haidt and Lenore Skenazy, has been advocating for the return of independent play for children. As a result of their efforts, eight states have passed laws that specifically address this issue.

These laws state that allowing a child to play outside unsupervised cannot be used as evidence of child neglect. This is significant because, in the past, ambiguous laws have led to situations where parents faced potential legal consequences for letting their children play independently.

For example, if a parent sent their 8-year-old child to a store alone, and a concerned neighbor called the police, it could potentially escalate to involvement with Child Protective Services. These new laws aim to prevent such scenarios and protect parents who choose to give their children more independence.

It's important to note that these laws are not universal across the United States. They have been passed in eight states, but the specific states are not mentioned in the provided context. Parents should be aware of the laws in their particular state regarding unsupervised play and child neglect definitions.

The goal of these laws is to stop the incentivization of helicopter parenting and to provide more safe spaces for children to play independently. This legal approach is part of a broader effort to restore play-based childhood experiences in the real world, which are seen as crucial for healthy child development.

where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "whatever but um but kids need to be out playing with each other especially Outdoors we evolved in savanas we evolved in different parts of the world we're attracted to Nature um so that's the way it it always was now uh especially if we in the 1950s and 60s America just been through a World War and the greatest way to make people trust each other the greatest way to boost social capital is a foreign attack and of course Pearl Harbor did more for American Co coherence than anything else in history in modern history 911 did that too but only for a little while and then we we lost it um so for a a lot of reasons people trusted their neighbors kids were out playing you know my parents grew up in the depression in New York City the kids were all out playing stickball on the street or in a parking lot in the 1970s there is a real crime wave um crime goes through the roof actually and it goes through the 80s that goes all the way to the early 90s even still you were kicked out of the house to go play um even in New York City all kids went out to play that's just the way it was but we begin to lose trust in each other for a lot of reasons Robert putam wrote about this in Bowling alone the the the the loss of Social Capital many reasons for that the changing media environment air conditioning and television people are not hanging out on their porch in the summertime to get away from the Heat they Clos the door and they put on the AC and they watch TV family sizes are shrinking there are not that many kids around so for a lot of reasons by the the 90s is the key decade where act two of the tragedy happens and that's the loss of the play-based childhood", "most Instagram no so it the the huge time suck is the videos so it's actually Tik Tok and YouTube are counted in this analysis they're counted as social media YouTube is marginally social media it's more of an general information Source but the point is especially the short videos the short videos are really really addictive because the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the house every day to go play my mom would say get out of the house I now realize she wanted space yeah", "but we just need a norm now for for raising the age to 16 we can struggle to do that I'm doing that with my kids I'm saying no for my daughter no Snapchat till you're 16 16 um and she's the only one who doesn't have it it's painful for her and she's 14 um but my hope is that no parent again will be in that situation that in every school a lot of the parents are going to say no no social media till 16 now of course the laws currently state that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract give away your data and make a deal with a company without your parents knowledge or permission but Congress passed this terrible law in 1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy protection act it was supposed to set the age to 16 which is not which is I think pretty reasonable but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement it's the law is written such that as long as the company doesn't absolutely know that you're underage they're fine they're not responsible 13 they're motivated the companies are now the law motivates the companies to not know how old children are there's barely any forbrain at 13 that's right that's right and since all you have to do you just have to be old enough to lie about your age if you're old enough to lie about your age you can go anywhere on the internet because there's no enforcement so I'm saying let's take the age of 13 which is not enforced let's require age verification which is complicated but they're working on that in Britain they've they're mandating that it's going to happen in Britain we'll work out the technical details um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's the one place where I think we really do need law uh because social media is a social trap and if half the kids are on it there's going to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws", "I love what your mom did getting you guys outside um my parents did the same thing too like we I was very blessed to have two parents who didn't come you know they didn't have a lot of resources growing up they didn't come to this country with a lot of

the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out", "so in America and Britain we freaked out about child abduction and child sexual abuse um some of the scandals were real the Boy Scouts the Catholic Church there were cases where trusted organizations were covering up abuse and I recall the abduction thing the carton y thing right and there was a show I think my name is Brian you know about the kid who was abducted and then all he remembered I think it's a true story was that his name was Brian he would just remind himself every night about his real name you know I think they found him eventually in Berkeley mhm not calling out Berkeley I lived in Berkeley for a long time but um seemed to be the discovery of of Abu of abducted kid excuse me in Berkeley uh there are a few other cases there I don't know what that's about um in any of I grew up thinking that you could get kidnapped right yeah which yeah which is so it's I mean it's the most terrifying possibility for any parent um but when I was doing the research for the codling the American mind I found according to FBI statistics there's only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings a year in our whole country because if a child like who would take a child like it's a really difficult crime and you're going to you know who would steal a child from a store you know parents are afraid if your kid goes to the next D on the grocery store going to be how are you going to take a kicking and screaming kid out of a store um it's and yet sorry to interrupt but the show America's Most Wanted I believe was hosted by a guy whose kid was abducted and eventually found dead exactly Adam that's right right so so there was this propagation of this fear like that one of the deepest fears of any parent I can to imagine is is is that that's right but the point is that these crimes are extraordinarily rare it's almost always the non-custodial parent who takes a kid it's a family member because there's a fight within the family um so we fear the wrong things we're terrified of kidnapping um but locking our kids up overprotecting them has spiked the suicide rate so much that the death toll is vastly higher from the extra suicides than it would be if we could completely wipe out kidnapping which again doesn't", "so that's the third Norm is uh no uh is phonefree schools you have to lock up the phone in the morning either a lock in a phone lock or Yonder pouch um if the policy is you keep in your pocket that's not a policy that's just a recipe for constant conflict with the kids because they can't help it they have to text if anyone's texting they have to be texting and the fourth Norm is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real world because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing we have to do is restore a really fun adventurous childhood like you know what you were saying you know you go out on your bicycle you're hanging out with your friends friends sometimes something happens and boy you have memories I mean exciting things happen scary things happen you have memories and you know I worry about like what you know what boys today you know I have a group of Buddy my group of friends that I you know we we still talk about things that happened you know things that amazing things that happened when we were in college or after college and I wonder what boys young boys today are going to say you know you remember fortnite game 27363 where you were trapped in that Elevator Shaft and I had to shoot you out no I don't remember that one you know like uh the the virtual Adventures are just not going to cut it our kids need Adventure they need Independence and Adventure uh where they work out the conflicts themselves"]

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll focus on the key points from the context about mental health trends for girls since the early 2010s. The main aspects to cover are:
1. The sharp increase in mental health issues starting around 2012
2. The specific mental health problems that have increased
3. The magnitude of the increase
4. How this trend compares to boys
5. The potential causes mentioned, particularly related to smartphones and social media
</thinking>

Since the early 2010s, there have been significant changes in mental health trends for girls. The most notable shift occurred around 2012, when there was a sudden and dramatic increase in various mental health issues among girls. This change has been described as a "hockey stick" pattern, with a sharp upward turn in the data.

The main mental health problems that have seen a substantial increase include:
1. Depression
2. Anxiety
3. Self-harm

The magnitude of this increase is quite significant. According to the information provided, most measures show increases in the range of 50% to 150%, with some nearly doubling. This is not a subtle change but a major shift in mental health patterns for girls.

Interestingly, while boys have also experienced increases in depression and anxiety, the pattern for them is different. The increase for boys began slightly earlier (around 2009-2010) and has been more gradual, without the sharp uptick seen in girls' data.

This trend is not limited to self-reported data. Similar patterns have been observed in more objective measures, such as hospital admissions for self-harm and psychiatric emergency department visits. This trend is also not confined to a single country but has been observed across many developed nations, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Scandinavian countries.

The context strongly suggests that the rise of smartphones and social media may be a significant factor in this trend. The timing of the increase coincides with the widespread adoption of smartphones and social media platforms. The impact on girls seems to be particularly pronounced, possibly due to the nature of their social interactions online and the heightened use of these technologies.

It's important to note that while this trend is concerning, it's part of a complex picture of mental health, and individual cases can have many contributing factors. However, the widespread nature of this change across different countries and its correlation with smartphone adoption make it a significant area of concern and study.

2012 in other countries but the girls graphs are very sharp the boys are also up on depression anxiety they're also way up depending on the measure it's usually everything is in the ballpark of 50 to 150% almost all the numbers are in that range um we're not talking 10 or 20% increases here for most things we're talking close to a doubling especially for the younger girls the boys curves interestingly are smoother that is the boys are more depressed and anxious it's but it's not 2012 it it actually often begins begins more like 2009 2010 and then it just keeps going up gradually so that that's a real clue um which we'll come back when we talk about the the boy story um it a lot of people say oh you know it's just self-report um you know just gen Z they're really they're really

mental health in particular in girls yeah so feel free to hit us with the with the scary truth okay sure so let's imagine so in the US we have really good statistics based on annual or biannual surveys there's three or four big ones that allow us to see what's happened since the 70s and so what I'd like listeners to imagine is imagine a bunch of lines maybe a line for boys maybe a line a line for boys line for girls showing the percentage that suffer from anxiety depression or that have self harm those three really go together and imagine these lines they move around a little bit but they're actually pretty stable from the 1990s all the way through 2010 even 2011 there's no sign of a problem on some measures they're getting actually a little bit better because stable and low stable well low you know if it's if they're around say 12 15 % of girls qualify as having had a major depression you know that's much higher than we would like um that's a problem", "but the fact that we see the exact same curves the very sharp uptick for girls um in Hospital admissions for self harm psychiatric emergency Department visits and we see this in the US Canada Australia New Zealand uh the UK um the Scandinavian countries so something happened across the developed World um around 2012 and I keep you know Jee twangy was the first to really raise the alarm she and I keep saying well you know we can't find another candidate nothing else fits the pattern oh and there's actually not just correlational data there's experiment experimental data too", "so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "but there's this whole category of jokes like um you know when joaco was born um the doctor looked at his mother and said it's a man you know or or when jao left for college he looked at his father and said you're the man of the house now you know jokes like that you know there are tons and tons of these right so there's this whole so that's very YouTube male type humor it's it's one hit it's done it gets a ton of likes and it propagates yeah none of this two or three chess moves down the down the road um so it's very clapback sometimes in or in that case building up Joo who doesn't need any more building up but people do it anyway so things of that sort so interested in the in these um in the Nuance here because um you're telling me that girls are killing themselves more they're depressed their increase in suicide is larger boys have a much higher suicide rate so boy many more boys die from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or a bridge whereas girls tend to use pills or cutting their wrists and they and the great majority of girl suicide attempts don't lead to death yeah so are most of the issues with girls and online use social media it's sort of um uh it's despair it's at home anxious sad about self self- critiquing this kind of thing I mean you're telling me there's a a huge and I believe you that there's a tremendous increase I mean he said hockey stick like function um when we're looking at essentially capturing the tip of the p pyramid in terms of like extreme social interaction so take let me I'm not being very very clear here we have these neural circuits that evolved for social interactions that are more heightened in girls they're getting much more of it faster yeah and the consequences are no less and probably even more severe than they used to be"]

Ground Truths: ['Since the early 2010s, the mental health trends for girls have shown a significant increase in anxiety, depression, and self-harm. Specifically, around 2012, the percentage of girls suffering from these issues sharply rose, resembling a hockey stick curve, indicating a dramatic change compared to the stable rates observed from the 1990s to 2010. This increase is described as not subtle, with many measures showing close to a doubling of these mental health issues, particularly among younger girls.']

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I need to:
1. Identify the age set by COPPA for minors in contracts and data sharing
2. Explain how this aligns with current views on kids' social media access
3. Discuss any discrepancies or issues with the current age limit
4. Relate this to modern concerns about children's social media use
5. Provide relevant information from the context about proposed changes or recommendations
</thinking>

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) set the age for minors in contracts and data sharing at 13. This law was passed in 1998 and was originally intended to set the age at 16, which was considered more reasonable. However, it was pushed down to 13 with little enforcement.

This age limit of 13 does not align well with today's views on kids' social media access. Many experts and parents now believe that 13 is too young for unrestricted social media use. The law's current form motivates companies to avoid knowing children's actual ages, as they are not held responsible if they don't "absolutely know" a user is underage.

There are several issues with the current age limit:

1. Lack of enforcement: The law is written such that companies are not responsible as long as they don't definitively know a user is underage.
2. Ease of circumvention: Children can easily lie about their age to access social media platforms.
3. Developmental concerns: At 13, the prefrontal cortex is still developing, making children more vulnerable to the negative effects of social media.

Modern concerns about children's social media use focus on mental health impacts, privacy issues, and the potential for manipulation by large tech companies. Many experts, including Dr. Jonathan Haidt, are advocating for raising the age limit to 16 for social media access.

Recommendations for addressing these concerns include:

1. Raising the age limit to 16 for social media access.
2. Implementing stronger age verification methods.
3. Enforcing the age limit more strictly.
4. Creating social norms around delaying smartphone and social media access for children.

These recommendations aim to protect children during critical developmental periods and address the collective action problem where parents feel pressured to allow earlier access because "everyone else is doing it."

Cino to keep them in don't have a clock don't let them see what time it is keep them in don't let them click over to a link to another site keep them in um we somehow have seeded our children's childhood to Giant companies that have shown that they don't really care about our kids welfare they care much more about profitability and and they care about their customers who are the advertisers and these companies have been granted a special RIT from the King Congress said in in in the in section 230 of the communications decency act in 1996 I think it was Congress said oh and nobody sue you nobody can sue you for what you show to their kids uh there was a reason for that that you don't want AOL to be responsible for everything anyone posts but it's been so broadly interpreted that so far any attempt to regulate social media or any attempt to sue them is seen as like no no", "so I think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here too cuz Andrew my big concern with parents is look we've taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which we didn't grow up with as kids and we've told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this um you know when we were growing up you remember the motor vehicle fatalities were really high uh in America and we didn't say okay you know what that's just the price of Modern Life we just have to accept it and keep moving on with our lives we said hold on we don't have to go back to horses and Buggies but we also don't need to accept this death rate we need to make this experience safer and so we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups like Matt and others across the country that me Mothers Against Drunk Driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts airbags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that help helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents and deaths and that's what we need here too like we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting in place safety standards to protect kids from exposure to harmful content from from the experience of bullying and harassment and that also protect them from features that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use uh which is happening far too often right now we also need a policy that requires data transparency from the company you know researchers tell us all the time that they these are independent researchers they tell us they are having a hard time getting full access to the data from the social media platforms about the full impact of the platforms on the mental health of kids and as a parent look I I don't when we bought car seats for my children when when they were born we looked up the safety data like many parents we wanted to make sure the car seats were safe but if you had told me that hey you know the manufacturers of these car seats are actually not disclosing some of the the data on the impact on children uh but go ahead and buy it anyway", "oh these terrible devices um rather it's about a vision of childhood which is actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the reason why I got this far is because it's a set of collective action traps everyone every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone so the four recommendations I have are four ways of breaking out on the Trap but the first two are really about delaying and getting past this period of plasticity and you really help me see why it's so urgent to delay until late puberty at least so here are the four Norms that I think can break us out of this trap Norm number one uh no smartphone before high school you can give your kid a flip phone flip the Millennials had flip phones they came out fine no access or no smartphone of their own your own you can't have your own and that would even go for an iPad if you give your kid an iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it any you know anywhere in the house and you can take it outside even although maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the point is um the internet is an amazing thing and you know you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids and they can do things on the computer but you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to so it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone let them have a flip phone or a simple phone watch something like that that's rule number one rule number two is the most relevant for what we're just talking about and that is no social media until 16 there is I believe no way to make social media safe for children that is if they're going to be entering a domain in which Prestige is gained by having posts that get the most likes and followers you're making them be brand managers you're making them be performative this is not playful th", 'So,\n- Right.', "It's like-\n- Right. - Well-\n-", 'Like so-\n-', "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", '- Yeah-\n-', 'But-\n-', "but they haven't been the other is the sharing and we used to hear about pod parties where somebody buys the device which is more expensive buys the device and then you bring your own not beer bring your own pod which is a few dollars then you pop it in and then you share it around um we've also heard stories of a few teenagers buying them and then selling for a few cents or a few dollars a puff so meet me in the bathroom for 50 cents or a dollar you can have a couple of Puffs so I think teens are getting very very creative we've also seen unfortunately parents buying e cigarettes for their teens well at least they're not smoking cigarettes that's not the right comparison um so I think they're very creative they're getting into many many different ways I've heard students say I'm not using my lunch money to buy lunch I'm going to use it to buy Vapes um there's no one way uh there's not and unfortunately access is easier than it should by the way one thing I think is incredibly important for people to understand is across the US in 2019 December 2019 the legal age to be allowed to purchase or to sell nicotine products across the US is is become 21 so many people think it's so 18"]

Ground Truths: ["COPPA set the age for minors in contracts and data sharing at 13. This aligns with today's views on kids' social media access as there is a push to raise the age to 16, with concerns that the current age of 13 is not enforced and allows children to easily lie about their age to access social media."]

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll need to focus on information related to boys' mental health and neural circuits from a neurobiological perspective. The context provides some relevant information, particularly about neural circuits related to sex and violence in boys, as well as general information about adolescent brain development. I'll need to synthesize this information to provide insights on boys' mental health from a neurobiological standpoint.
</thinking>

Neurobiologists provide several insights into boys' mental health regarding neural circuits:

1. Heightened circuits for sex and violence: In boys, neural circuits related to sex and violence are particularly heightened. These circuits have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years and play a significant role in boys' behavior and mental processes.

2. Increased connectivity during puberty: During puberty, there's increased connectivity between different brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex (involved in motivation and decision-making), dopamine centers, and the amygdala. This integration allows for testing of circuits related to emotions and rewards as they pertain to decision-making.

3. Testing of social and physical interactions: The increased connectivity in adolescent brains leads to testing of social and physical interactions. This can sometimes result in unsafe behavior, as teens explore how different actions lead to success, fear states, or other outcomes.

4. Dopamine and emotion: There's a connection between dopamine centers in the brain and areas involved in emotion and dispersal. This relationship is particularly important during adolescence and puberty, potentially influencing boys' emotional experiences and behaviors.

5. Potential for circuit hyperactivity: While not specific to boys, research on bipolar disorder suggests that early hyperactivity in certain neural circuits can lead to diminished activity in those same circuits later in life. This highlights the complex nature of brain development and the potential long-term effects of early neural circuit activity.

It's important to note that while these insights provide a neurobiological perspective on boys' mental health, they don't paint a complete picture. The research presented is often general to adolescents or focused on specific conditions like bipolar disorder. More targeted research on boys' mental health and neural circuits would be needed for a more comprehensive understanding.

lot of changes and\nthickness of the brain at different stages, et cetera.\n\nBut I think most people will be interested in what that translates\nto in the real world.\n\nAnd what's interesting is during puberty, there's increased connection, connectivity as we call it\nbetween the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in\nmotivation and decision-making, being able to suppress action for making long-term goals possible, as well as dopamine\ncenters and the amygdala.\n\nSo there's this really broad\nintegration and testing.\n\nI think this is the key element here, testing of circuits\nfor emotions and reward as they relate to decisions.\n\nAnd I think that's useful because when you look at the behavior\nof adolescents and teens, they are testing social interactions, they are testing physical\ninteractions with the world.\n\nOftentimes they're engaging\nin unsafe behavior.\n\nI would never try and justify that with the underlying neurology, but the neuroscience points\nto increased connectivity between areas of the brain that\nare related to emotionality and to threat detection like\nthe amygdala, but also reward.\n\nSo it's a time of testing behaviorally how different behaviors\nlead to success or not.\n\nIt's how different behaviors\nlead to fear states or not.", "Now I'd like to talk a little bit more about what is known\nabout the neural circuits that lead to the manic states, as well as the depressive states, but mainly the manic\nstates of bipolar disorder.\n\nWe already discussed the\nfact that interception, registering of one's own internal emotions and bodily states is diminished in people with bipolar disorder.\n\nBut we haven't really talked\nabout the neural circuits that are responsible for\nthat lack of recognition.\n\nFor that reason, I'd like\nto point out a paper.\n\nThis is a fairly recent paper,\njust came out this year, but it's an excellent one, Looking at the changes over\ntime in neural circuitry in people with high genetic\nrisk for bipolar disorder, and in particular in young people.\n\nAnd studies of this sort are rare, but are exceedingly\nimportant because of the fact that they track individuals over time.\n\nThe title of this paper is, Longitudinal Changes in\nStructural Connectivity in Young People at High Genetic\nRisk for Bipolar Disorder.\n\nWe will provide a link to this study in the show note captions.", "So this isn't a case in which people with bipolar have a neural circuit or lack a neural circuit and people without\nbipolar are the opposite.\n\nThis is a case in which\neveryone more or less starts out the same, but it seems that there's a hyperactivity of certain neural circuits in people with bipolar disorder that over time actually causes those\ncircuits to diminish.\n\nNow, this is very important because some of the more recent longitudinal studies doing brain imaging on people with bipolar disorder and those without, and doing that over time in patients starting as early as their teens, but into their 20s and\n30s reveals just that, that there can be hyperactivity\nof circuits early on, but then hypo, reduced activity\nof those very same circuits at a time 5 or 10 years later.\n\nAgain, this speaks to\nthe complicated nature of bipolar disorder and\nthe complicated nature of psychiatry and linking\nspecific psychiatric disorders to neural circuits in general.", "So I want to visit a\nlittle bit of the research about some of the core needs that occurred during puberty and adolescence, not just for parents or for the people that might\nbe in puberty and adolescence, but also so that people can reflect on which of the sort of boxes\nwere checked off for them as they approached emotional maturity.\n\nSo there's a terrific review article that was published in the\njournal Nature, which is, if not the premier, then certainly among the\ntop three premier journals in the field of science about the biology of\nadolescence and puberty, as well as some of the\ncore needs and demands that have to be met for successful emotional\nmaturation during that time.\n\nWe will provide a link to that, but I just want to highlight a few of the things that they\nplace in the final table.\n\nI don't want to go through\nall the results right now, because you could do that\non your own if you like.\n\nThey mainly highlight a lot of the changes in\nneurons and neural circuits.\n\nFor instance, I'll just highlight one, there's a connection between the dopamine centers in the brain and an area of the brain that's involved in emotion and dispersal.\n\nDispersal is very interesting.", "So we have two major sets\nof neural circuit deficits or changes in people with bipolar.\n\nTheir lack of internal\nawareness is reduced, and that turns out to be,\nby way of neural structures, like the insula which is a brain region that is connected in a very direct way to our somatosensory cortex, so the part of our cortex that registers how we feel, literally, sense of\ntouch and internal state.\n\nSo those circuits, excuse me, for those for those of you listening I just bumped the microphone, excuse me.\n\nThose circuits are disrupted\nin people with bipolar and the top down control, that kind of accelerator and break on our overall levels of\nenergy are also disrupted.\n\nNow that's all fine and good because, well, it's true, at least according to what the data at this point in time tell us, there may be new discoveries to come, but that all seems to be the case, but it doesn't tell us how to modulate or change that circuitry.\n\nIt also doesn't tell us\nhow something like lithium can actually benefit a\nlarge number of patients or how a good number\nof the other treatments for bipolar disorder, which\nwe'll talk about going forward can benefit patients with bipolar.", "but there's this whole category of jokes like um you know when joaco was born um the doctor looked at his mother and said it's a man you know or or when jao left for college he looked at his father and said you're the man of the house now you know jokes like that you know there are tons and tons of these right so there's this whole so that's very YouTube male type humor it's it's one hit it's done it gets a ton of likes and it propagates yeah none of this two or three chess moves down the down the road um so it's very clapback sometimes in or in that case building up Joo who doesn't need any more building up but people do it anyway so things of that sort so interested in the in these um in the Nuance here because um you're telling me that girls are killing themselves more they're depressed their increase in suicide is larger boys have a much higher suicide rate so boy many more boys die from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or a bridge whereas girls tend to use pills or cutting their wrists and they and the great majority of girl suicide attempts don't lead to death yeah so are most of the issues with girls and online use social media it's sort of um uh it's despair it's at home anxious sad about self self- critiquing this kind of thing I mean you're telling me there's a a huge and I believe you that there's a tremendous increase I mean he said hockey stick like function um when we're looking at essentially capturing the tip of the p pyramid in terms of like extreme social interaction so take let me I'm not being very very clear here we have these neural circuits that evolved for social interactions that are more heightened in girls they're getting much more of it faster yeah and the consequences are no less and probably even more severe than they used to be", "These circuits that we're\ncalling pro-social circuits light up in the brain in neuroimaging, meaning the neurons are\nfiring more actively, more electrically robustly; sort of like turning up the volume on these neural circuits in the brain.\n\nAnd the neural circuits in the brain that are associated with\naversive or defensive behaviors; things like backing up things, like covering up the\nvital organs of the body, things like a quaking of the voice, all of the things are associated\nwith defensive behaviors are actually antagonized,\nmeaning they are reduced when the pro-social\ncircuits are more active.\n\nSo the framework here that I'd like to set is that we have this kind of seesaw of neural circuits in the brain.\n\nOne set that are\npro-social and are designed to bring us closer to\nothers, including ourselves, closer to certain sensory\nexperiences, right?\n\nBecause a lot of pro-social behaviors can also be geared towards\nthings like pets or food, or anything that we find\nwe want to be closer to and want more of.", "Now I bridge to this conversation\nabout neural circuits from the statement that\nlithium can protect against some of the neurotoxic effects of neural circuits being very active.\n\nNow this can get a little bit complicated, but I promise I'm going to make it clear for any of you that are\nwatching and or listening.\n\nThe reality is that people with bipolar depression very likely have a hyperactivity, that is an increased level of activity in certain circuits within the brain early in the expression of their disease.\n\nAnd that typically, as\nI mentioned earlier, sets in around the early\n20s, although sometimes that can be even earlier,\nin the teens and so forth.\n\nBut that hyperactivity, we think, leads to a toxicity and excitotoxicity of certain elements of the neural circuits that are responsible for interoception.\n\nIn other words, the overuse of certain\ncircuits can lead to a diminishing, an atrophy, or even a death of certain elements within those circuits and it appears that lithium, through its anti-inflammatory\nand neuroprotective effects and through its ability to increase BDNF, very likely protects us against some of that atrophy of those\ncircuits for interoception."]

Ground Truths: ['Neurobiologists provide insights that the neural circuits related to sex and violence in boys have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years and are heightened, leading to more severe consequences in behavior and interactions. They suggest that the underlying issues, akin to an iceberg, are not being addressed, and the effects of these neural circuits are becoming more potent and rapid.']
