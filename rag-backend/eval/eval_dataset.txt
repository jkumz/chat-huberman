Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll focus on the following key points from the context:
1. The importance of experiences over deprivation in child development
2. The role of positive experiences in shaping neural circuits and behavior
3. The impact of play and unstructured time on child development
4. The significance of emotional regulation and social interactions

I'll structure the answer to highlight these aspects and their significance for children's development.
</thinking>

Prioritizing experiences over deprivation is crucial for children's development as it shapes their neural circuits, emotional regulation, and social skills in significant ways.

Firstly, providing children with a variety of positive experiences helps strengthen neural pathways that support healthy development. As mentioned in the context, when children have strongly reinforcing experiences, the neural circuits associated with those behaviors are strengthened, making it easier for them to repeat those behaviors in the future. This process is largely driven by dopamine and acetylcholine, which play key roles in learning and plasticity.

Secondly, prioritizing experiences allows children to develop emotional regulation skills. By engaging children in activities that excite them and also provide immediate pleasure, parents can help balance the dopaminergic (anticipation) and serotonergic (contentment) systems. This balance is essential for healthy adult relationships and emotion regulation later in life.

Thirdly, providing diverse experiences, especially through play and unstructured time, is vital for children's social and cognitive development. Unstructured play time allows children to explore, be creative, reflect, and interact with peers in ways that are crucial for their mental health and wellbeing. These experiences help children develop social skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity.

Lastly, prioritizing experiences over deprivation helps children develop a healthy mindset about various aspects of life. For example, exposing children to positive experiences with healthy foods can help them develop a mindset that "healthy foods are indulgent and delicious," rather than viewing them as a chore.

In contrast, environments of deprivation or neglect can have negative impacts on development. Studies on enriched environments for animals have shown that providing varied experiences and stimuli leads to better brain development compared to deprived conditions.

It's important to note that while early experiences are crucial, development is a lifelong process. Even if a child has experienced trauma or stress, which can make it harder to engage in play or access neuroplasticity, these effects are not permanent and can be overcome with appropriate interventions and experiences later in life.

Retrieved Contexts: ['So this is actually really\nimportant to understand that a baby, when you were a\nbaby, and when I was a baby, we didn\'t have any sense\nof the outside world except that it responded to our\nacts of anxiety essentially.\n\nNow this isn\'t Freudian theory, There are components of it that are embedded in Freudian theory, but all developmental\npsychologists agree that babies lack the ability to make cognitive sense\nof the outside world, but in this feeling of anxiety and registering one\'s own internal state, and then crying out to the outside world, either through crying\nor subtle vocalizations, or even just cuing, making some noise, we start to develop a relationship\nwith the outside world in which our internal states, our shifts and anxiety\nstart to drive requests, and people come and respond\nto those requests, hopefully.\n\nAnd the reason I say hopefully is that we\'ve all heard presumably about these cases of neglect.\n\nThere are a lot of cases\nwhere if you neglect a baby, you neglect an adolescent or a teenager, development doesn\'t go well, and we\'ll touch on some of those.\n\nBut those are really extreme cases.\n\nThey\'re sort of like the\nparallel to experiments that are often done in the\nlaboratory with animals, where you\'ve probably heard\nof these enriched environments where they\'ll give mice a bunch of toys, and they\'ll give them some different foods\nevery once in a while, and they\'ll house them\ntogether with other mice.\n\nAnd then what you find\nis that the animals, they will say, "Oh, their brain is thicker and their neurons have more\nbranches to them and all that."', 'But that\'s really comparing\ndeprivation with normalcy.\n\nWhat we want to center on today instead is what happens when things go well, and why things might not go well in certain circumstances is interesting.\n\nBut to me, not as interesting as what healthy emotional\ndevelopment looks like.\n\nAnd if you haven\'t achieved\nhealthy emotional development, what can be done as an intervention at later times in order to rescue that?\n\nSo the baby, you as a baby, you\'re flopping around there in your crib, you\'re getting care where you need it and when you need it, presumably, and this gets to the basis\nof what emotions are about, which are emotions are\nreally about forming bonds and being able to predict\nthings in the world.\n\nThat\'s really what emotions are about.\n\nWhether or not the baby\nfeels angry or happy or sad, we don\'t know, we can\nguess, but we don\'t know.\n\nIn fact, most of the time we\ndon\'t even know how we feel, let alone how other people feel, and that\'s true for adults.\n\nSo if I asked you how you feel right now, I don\'t know that you could tell me in any kind of rich\nlanguage that I would say, "Oh I really understand."', "- Your child real, real child.\n\nThe real kind of experiment.\n\n- It's how do I resist the urge to force my child to eat her dinner so that she can have her dessert, right?\n\nBecause that's the real urge.\n\nIt's like, no, you need\n- Or you're negotiating.\n\n- to do that.\n\nBecause when you start thinking about it in terms of mindset, you realize, oh, that's just reinforcing to her, that the dessert is the\nexciting, fun thing to have.\n\nAnd this thing that I have\nto do must be horrible.\n\nSo horrible that my parent is\nforcing me to do it, right?\n\nSo it's letting go a\nlittle bit of the behavior, the objective reality, and really thinking about\nthe subjective reality and focusing on adaptive mindsets.\n\nSo my goal as a parent has been to try to help her\ninstill a healthy mindset about eating, that healthy foods are\nindulgent and delicious.\n\nThat the experience of\nstress is inevitable, that it's natural.\n\nAnd that going through\nstressful experience can help her learn, grow, and become a more connected\nand happier individual.\n\nAnd with exercise and physical activity, we haven't really gotten to that yet, but [laughs] we will with time.", "yeah so I think it's it's really I mean I'm I'm so I'm a parent I have two kids that are in public school and I think their Public Schools rated you know it's fine Buton say it's all right and um but but at their school they definitely do get education about um more holistic health and emotional regulation I think and and considering others um that's been that's that's a big focus of the school and I think that's actually really important I I I I mean you know again I'm I'm super biased from from my upbringing but my kids are going to learn math whenever it's time to learn the that they'll learn it whenever they need it you know whenever they need it they're going to learn it in a couple I don't know a couple weeks and figure out do the thing um most of the things that they learn they're going to forget them and then have to relearn them um so what are the things that you're going to really need to know no matter what you choose to do and I think regulating your your own emotions and and and engaging other individuals in a healthy sustainable way that you know and I mean sustainable in terms of the longevity of their relationships and I think those are the things that end up really mattering so I think um also this question about exposure to abundance and scarcity uh is really interesting too I mean I don't know if that's a direction we want to go into so please yeah well I think you know this whole you know it sort sounds sort of new Agy when I say you know abundant the abundance mindset", "Leveraging different kinds\nof social relationships that reinforce positive behavior.\n\nThis is starting to sound like\nkind of a boiler plate stuff.\n\nAnd yet, really the goal is during puberty to encourage as many\nsafe forms of interaction that allow children, teens,\nreally and adolescents, I keep calling them children, but what I mean are children\ngoing through puberty, that allow them to test\nthis thing of autonomy so that they can start\nto make good assessments about their exteroceptive\nevents that they are selecting and how those make them feel internally.\n\nSo they're essentially doing a buffet.\n\nThe buffet has now broadened to not just include the\nevents and experiences that their parents and\nother caretakers bring them, but they can now expand the buffet into things that they\ncan provide themselves.\n\nAnd so adolescence and puberty is really seen as the\nperiod of development in which one self-samples\nfor these two elements that we talked about at\nthe beginning, which are, how do I form bonds and how do I make predictions about what will make me feel good at a level of interoception.", "It's very apparent that\nhealthy social bonding between children and caretaker relies on the fact that\nboth this right brain system and the left brain system are engaged, that there's a synchronization\nof autonomic function, meaning a joining together\nin actual somatic feeling, and that there's a\nsynchronization of experience that's more about some\noutward or external stimulus, like reading a book or\nwatching a show together or enjoying some common\nexperience of a meal together.\n\nAnd of course, as children get older, they're able to access\nmore and more cognitively sophisticated things.\n\nYou can watch a movie with them and they'll make predictions\nabout which characters are going to show up for instance, or you can take to a concert and they can appreciate the\nconcert or play in that concert, and they appreciate that\nthey're being appreciated.", '- It reminds me, as a neurobiologist, was weaned in the landscape\nof so-called critical periods, where early life environment\nvery strongly shapes the brain.\n\nAnd so many studies were\ndone on animals raised in traditional cages with a\nwater bottle and some food, maybe a few other animals\nof the same species.\n\nAnd then people came along and said, wait, normally these species in\nthe wild would have things like things to climb over\nand things to go through, and you provide those very basic elements, and all of a sudden the\narchitecture of neural circuits looks very different, and you realize that were studying a deprived condition.', "One of my favorite things\nabout developmental biology and developmental psychology is that it is grounded in the fact that we don't just have a\nchildhood and an adulthood.\n\nThere isn't just our child\nself and our adult self.\n\nAnd even though there\nare transitions around the mechanisms that\nunderline neuroplasticity at approximately age 25, it is simply the case that development is our entire lifespan, that our lifespan is one\nlong developmental arc.\n\nHow long depends on our\ngenetics, our lifestyle accidents, injury and disease of course, but it is one long developmental arc.\n\nAnd so it shouldn't surprise us at all that how we learn to play as\na 10 year old or 12 year old would impact how we play\nand interact with people as a teenager and a young adult and on and on and on.\n\nAnd that play is the\nplace in which we explore in which we learn play is the substrate by which our nervous system changes us from this hyper-connected\nbatch of neurons, where everything is\nconnected to everything, more or less to a brain and nervous system whereby certain circuits work\nwith immense proficiency and others are less accessible to us.", "And there's a beautiful model of emotional development\nthat was developed by Alan shore professor at UCLA and psychiatrist that

positive anticipation.", "but I worry that right now that we've almost somehow made that kind of unstructured time seem inefficient you know we've set these standards uh for our kids that they need to be uh you know getting fancy jobs and into fancy colleges and making an x amount of money and the path to doing that is you know to be enrolled in X number of activities after school and to do all this stuff in school and their lives are so hyper structured um that I worry that the time to just play to be creative to reflect and think to just have unstructured time with other kids has evaporated and I think that that also is hurting the mental health and wellbeing of our children I love the idea that that unstructured play time could be framed in the accurate context of the nervous system developing the way it was supposed to develop I mean I would argue that um success is going to be easiest for children that engage in the real world more in fact there's great risk to posting everything that you do online we've seen some examples of that preventing people from getting into or staying in college based on things they said or did previously that they shouldn't have said or done um that's those are kind of you know negative highlighted cases but in general um we know that the the nervous system thrives on diversity of types of interactions and social interactions in particular I'm just restating what you just said", "oh my goodness there's there's abundance here of something oh time to learn something new that's right we've we've overemphasized the extent to which plasticity is driven by punishment but the the neuromodulators that allow for plasticity in particular in puberty and as adults are largely dopamine dependent and acetylcholine dependent um the acetylcholine generally increases Focus um broadly speaking I mean does a bunch of other things controls muscular contraction Etc but so what we're basically saying here is that if a kid gets a strongly reinforcing experience I I'd be willing to bet both arms that the neural circuits that help generate whatever behaviors led to that experience are going to be strengthened in one trial to the extent that it will be very easy to generate those those behaviors again okay so this okay thank you this is exactly what I wanted to know to to deepen my the theorizing that I do in the book um so now this is actually the perfect time for us to switch over to the four recommendation the four main recommendations because they build exactly on what you just said they help me explain why this is so important so um so you know I think one one reason why the book seems to be doing very well and people seem to like and pass it on is that it's not just Doom and Gloom it's not just oh we've messed up our kids", "Now, one of the key findings that\nhas emerged from the literature is children that have\nbeen subjected to trauma or immense amounts of stress of any kind, have a harder time both engaging in play, but also a harder time\naccessing neuroplasticity later in life.\n\nThe good news is this is\nnot a permanent effect.\n\nAnd we'll talk about some\nof the ways to overcome that in a moment, but this should make sense to you because earlier we talked about how a high level of adrenaline epinephrine in the brain and body actually inhibits blocks the circuits in the brain and body that\ngenerate play behavior.\n\nAnd when I say that, I mean that in a very concrete way, that epinephrine and adrenaline can actually suppress\nthe sorts of circuitry that can lead to things like soft eyes or tongue out, or the head tilt, or what we called partial postures of being able to engage in, you know, a rough and tumble play, but not take that to the\npoint of outright aggression and damaging the other\nperson or them damaging you."]

Ground Truths: ["Prioritizing experiences over deprivation is significant for children's development as it fosters trust in kids to sort things out and be safe. Statistics suggest that children are more likely to thrive under conditions that allow for experiences rather than facing deprivation, which can lead to a more positive development environment."]

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll focus on the information provided about high-risk environments, particularly the example of Navy SEAL teams. I'll explain what it means for team members to be relentlessly hard on each other in these contexts, emphasizing the purpose and benefits of this approach. I'll also contrast this with toxic environments to highlight the difference.
</thinking>

In high-risk environments, such as Navy SEAL teams, being "relentlessly hard on each other" refers to a practice of constant, rigorous evaluation and feedback among team members. This approach serves several important purposes:

1. Maintaining high standards: By consistently challenging each other, team members ensure that everyone performs at their best. This is crucial in high-stakes situations where mistakes can have severe consequences.

2. Building resilience: The constant pressure helps team members develop mental toughness and the ability to perform under stress.

3. Fostering trust and respect: Paradoxically, this seemingly harsh treatment can lead to stronger bonds between team members. As one example mentions, "athletes often are very good friends and some of the people they respect the most are the folks who they're battling."

4. Promoting growth: By identifying and addressing weaknesses, team members help each other improve continuously.

5. Ensuring safety: In high-risk environments, being critical of each other's performance can be a matter of life and death.

It's important to note that this approach is different from toxic or destructive criticism. In healthy high-performance teams, the hard treatment is task-oriented and aimed at improvement, not personal attacks. As one source mentions, there's "a huge difference between competition that's oriented on tasks which can help us be the best version of ourselves and competition that bleeds into judgment suspicion and mistrust."

This relentless approach is often coupled with strong bonds of trust and loyalty. As Jocko Willink points out, a team that has strong relationships and mutual care will outperform a team where members dislike each other, even if they're equally skilled.

In summary, being relentlessly hard on each other in high-risk environments is a deliberate strategy to maintain peak performance, build resilience, and ensure safety, while paradoxically strengthening team bonds and mutual respect.

this is what's known as stack ranking and um you know this is where people managers are forced to pick the highest performing and lowest performing members of their team and in essence eliminate the people who are at the bottom 10% every six or 12 months stack ranking has thankfully mostly fallen out of favor in in the corporate world but it was very uh Durer um in the late 20th and early 21st century you know up until 10 or so years ago and it still exists in some places and the idea again was if you want people to be creative if you want them to do their best tap into who they really are and who are we really we are really a hyper individualistic again Darwin species it's really stack ranking is a social darwinist approach to management and the idea is well great if you threaten

Ground Truths: ["In high-risk environments, being relentlessly hard on each other means that team members maintain a high level of accountability and rigor, often using humor as a way to cope with the stress. This approach fosters a culture where individuals push each other to perform at their best, recognizing the high stakes involved. It creates an environment of trust and reliance on each other's skills, allowing team members to step up when needed while also being able to rest when others take the lead."]

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll focus on the neurobiological perspective of heightened behaviors and interactions related to neural circuits. I'll draw from the context that discusses:
1. Pro-social circuits and their activation
2. The concept of neural circuits as collections of brain areas working together
3. The role of specific brain areas like the nucleus accumbens in social behavior
4. The interaction between different neural circuits for various behaviors
5. The plasticity and adaptability of these circuits
</thinking>

From a neurobiological perspective, heightened behaviors and interactions related to neural circuits can be understood as the result of increased activation and connectivity between specific brain areas. 

Neurobiologists view these behaviors through the lens of "pro-social circuits" in the brain. When these circuits are activated, there's an increase in neuronal firing, which can be observed through neuroimaging as a "lighting up" of certain brain areas. This heightened activity is analogous to "turning up the volume" on these neural circuits.

Interestingly, when pro-social circuits are more active, they tend to inhibit circuits associated with aversive or defensive behaviors. This creates a kind of "seesaw" effect in the brain, where increased activity in one set of circuits can lead to decreased activity in another.

These neural circuits are not isolated to individual brain areas but involve collections of brain regions working together to engage patterns of behaviors. For instance, the nucleus accumbens and its associated circuitry play a crucial role in decision-making processes related to social interactions, influencing which behaviors we choose to pursue or avoid.

Neurobiologists also emphasize that these circuits are highly plastic and adaptable. The neural circuitry involved in social behaviors seems particularly amenable to behavioral plasticity, meaning it can change and adapt based on experiences and environmental factors.

Moreover, these circuits don't operate in isolation but interact with various neurotransmitter systems. Dopamine and serotonin, for example, are thought to modulate the activity of these circuits, influencing our social behaviors and interactions.

It's important to note that while we have a general understanding of these processes, many of the specific mechanisms are still being researched. As one neuroscientist in the context admitted, while we know many of the connections and brain areas involved, providing a coherent hypothesis or diagram of how it all happens remains a challenge in the field.

to come up with better ones, is what I alluded\nto earlier, is that it was very adaptive when we were more primitive organisms,\nnever mind non human primates, but when we were whatever we were, to be a social\nspecies for basically primarily two reasons, for reproductive purposes, it\nincreased your likelihood of reproducing if you were hanging out with other members of your species in a non aggressive way and for protection against predators.\n\nAnd there may be other reasons, probably.", "Andrew Huberman: So, in thinking about\nsocial interactions and leaving aside anything related to autism, for the\nmoment, it appears that the circuits in the brain that mediate the desire to spend\ntime with others of the same species, maybe even with other species like a\ndog, are fairly hardwired but modifiable.\n\nWe were born with the capacity\nto build them up and that social behavior is highly rewarded.\n\nIs it rewarded through\nthe dopamine system?\n\nAnd what, if any, involvement is\nthere of the serotonergic system?\n\nAnd we haven't talked about\nserotonin yet, but I'd love to bring up serotonin at this point.\n\nMaybe you could educate us a little\nbit about

oxytocin, and that collaborate with\nthe autonomic nervous system to drive what we call\ndesire, love and attachment.\n\nAnd the three circuits are\nautonomic nervous system, we talked about that one.\n\nThen there's the nervous system components or the neural circuits for\nempathy, for being able to see and respond to indeed\nmatch the emotional tone or the autonomic tone of another.\n\nAnd then there's the third category, and this might surprise some of you, it certainly surprised me, but the data point to the fact\nthat the third neural circuit that's very important\nfor establishing

about\nthose neural circuits and what they are.\n\nNow, often when we hear empathy, we think, oh, empathy is really about\nlistening to and really understanding what\nsomebody else is

Andrew Huberman: You're still going.", "- Right, that is a central question.\n\nI can say, at least with\nrespect to the fear neurons that sit on top of the aggression neurons, we know that when those neurons are activated optogenetically, in the same way we would\nactivate the aggression neurons, that there's clearly an arousal\nprocess that's occurring, you can see the pupils\ndilate in the animal.\n\nThere is an increase in stress hormone release\ninto the bloodstream, we've shown that heart rate goes up.\n\nSo in addition to the\ndrive to actually freeze, which is what those animals do, there is autonomic arousal and neuroendocrine activation\nof stress responses.\n\nAnd some of that is probably shared by the aggression neurons\nand the mating neurons, although we haven't investigated\nit in as much detail, but I wouldn't be surprised because they project to\nmany of the same regions that the fear neurons project to, which is a interesting issue in the context to discuss later maybe, in the context of why we're comfortable with mental illnesses that are based on maladaptations of fear,\nbut not mental illnesses that are based on\nmaladaptations of aggression

electrical\nstimulation in an experiment, believe it or not, that's been done in\nboth animals and humans, animals and humans become\nvery, very motivated to get more stimulation of these pathways.\n\nSo this pleasure pathway or\nthese circuits for pleasure are very what we call reinforcing.\n\nIn fact, animals and humans will work hard to get stimulation of these brain areas even more than they will\nwork to obtain sex, drugs, or even if they are addicted\nto a particular drug and they are in a state of withdrawal, the ultimate state of craving, if given a choice, a person or an animal will select to have stimulation\nof this pleasure pathway instead of the drug itself.\n\nAnd that is a major and\nsignificant finding.", "Andrew Huberman: So using that as a\nframework to think about social behavior, as you said, pro social, non aggressive,\nnon sexual interactions involve the choice of a lot of behaviors, but also\nthe suppression of a lot of behaviors.\n\nMaybe you're starting to\nsense what I'm doing here.\n\nI think for people to understand how a\nsingle structure like the accumbens could mediate social interaction and reward\nit, what it sounds like it's doing is rewarding a certain category and catalog\nof behavioral options and punishing, or at least reducing the probability of the\noccurrence of other behavioral actions.\n\nBecause when I go to dinner\nwith friends, if I know them really well, I might hug them.\n\nI might even say something\nmildly inappropriate if I know the context to be safe, right?\n\nBut at a dinner interview or a

really broad\nintegration and testing.\n\nI think this is the key element here, testing of circuits\nfor emotions and reward as they relate to decisions.\n\nAnd I think that's useful because when you look at the behavior\nof adolescents and teens, they are testing social interactions, they are testing physical\ninteractions with the world.\n\nOftentimes they're engaging\nin unsafe behavior.\n\nI would never try and justify that with the underlying neurology, but the neuroscience points\nto increased connectivity between areas of the brain that\nare related to emotionality and to threat

human brain imaging studies suggest is\nactivated during empathic human responses.\n\nAnd the projections of that\narea into the nucleus accumbens.\n\nThat\'s the connection.\n\nAnd we\'re interested in whether\nneuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin may influence this circuitry,\nthese connections that are involved in these "empathic" behaviors, etc. , etc .\n\nAnd we think drugs can be\nused as probes of those kinds of neuromodulatory mechanisms.\n\nI hope this is all making sense.', "Today's discussion explores all of\nthese topics, and by the end of today's discussion, you will have a rich\nunderstanding of how neurochemicals like dopamine and serotonin work in parallel,\nto reinforce that is, to increase the probability that we will engage in\ncertain types of thinking and

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll need to:
1. Identify key differences between social media addiction and traditional substance addictions like tobacco from the context
2. Focus on the social aspects of social media addiction
3. Highlight the differences in biological vs. social addiction mechanisms
4. Mention the differences in addiction patterns and prevalence
5. Note any similarities or overlaps between the two types of addiction
</thinking>

Social media addiction differs from traditional substance addictions like tobacco in several key ways:

1. Addiction mechanism: Social media addiction is primarily a social addiction, rather than a biochemical addiction. Unlike tobacco, which is biologically addictive due to nicotine, social media doesn't have a specific chemical compound causing physical dependence. Instead, it operates on social and psychological levels.

2. Prevalence and spread: Social media addiction tends to be more widespread and can affect entire populations rapidly. As Dr. Jonathan Haidt points out, with tobacco, even at its peak, only about 37% of American high school students smoked. In contrast, social media adoption is often an all-or-nothing phenomenon, especially among younger populations. It's either "none or everybody," and it typically happens as early as middle school.

3. Accessibility and integration: Social media is deeply integrated into daily life and is much more accessible than substances like tobacco. It's constantly available through smartphones and other devices, making it easier to develop compulsive behaviors.

4. Feedback mechanisms: Social media provides immediate feedback and rewards through likes, comments, and notifications. This instant gratification can activate reward circuits in the brain, albeit not as intensely as drugs like cocaine or opioids.

5. Perception of harm: There's often less awareness of the addictive potential of social media compared to well-known substance addictions. As Dr. Anna Lembke notes, people getting addicted to social media often don't realize it's happening until after the fact.

6. Withdrawal and quitting: While both types of addiction can be difficult to overcome, the nature of withdrawal differs. Tobacco addiction involves physical withdrawal symptoms, whereas social media addiction withdrawal is more psychological and social in nature.

However, it's important to note that there are some similarities. Both can lead to compulsive behaviors, and both can activate reward circuits in the brain. Dr. Robert Malenka describes how checking messages on his phone has a "compulsive, addictive quality" similar to a lever press for a mouse in an experiment.

In conclusion, while both social media and tobacco can be addictive, the mechanisms, patterns, and societal impacts of these addictions are quite distinct, with social media addiction being more of a social and psychological phenomenon compared to the primarily biological addiction of tobacco.

Ground Truths: ["Social media addiction is distinguished from traditional substance addictions like tobacco in that it is a social addiction rather than a biological one. Unlike tobacco, which is biologically addictive and can lead to a significant percentage of a population being addicted, social media addiction affects everyone, particularly in middle school, and cannot have just a third of users addicted; it's either none or everybody."]

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll need to analyze the provided context for information on:
1. How gambling affects loneliness and emotions
2. How social media affects loneliness and emotions
3. Any comparisons or connections between gambling and social media effects
4. Specific emotional and social impacts mentioned

I'll structure the answer to address both gambling and social media, their effects on loneliness and emotions, and draw connections where possible.
</thinking>

Gambling and social media can both have significant impacts on loneliness and emotions, often in ways that are interconnected and potentially harmful.

Gambling, particularly when it becomes addictive, can lead to intense emotional experiences. For some individuals, gambling becomes a form of self-medication. As described by Dr. Jonathan Haidt, a gambling addict may feel terrible about their life choices and the consequences of their addiction, but they continue to gamble because it provides a temporary escape. The gambler experiences a brief period of feeling good while engaged in the activity, despite the overall negative impact on their life. This cycle can perpetuate feelings of shame and isolation, potentially exacerbating loneliness.

Social media, while different in nature, can have similarly complex effects on emotions and social connections. Dr. Vivek Murthy, the U.S. Surgeon General, points out that while social media has increased our ability to communicate, it has paradoxically led to increased loneliness and decreased understanding between people. Young people, in particular, report that social media often makes them feel worse about themselves and their friendships. The constant comparison to others online can erode self-esteem, which in turn makes it harder to form genuine connections in real life.

Both gambling and social media appear to tap into the brain's reward circuits, potentially leading to addictive behaviors. Dr. Robert Malenka suggests that social media platforms have likely capitalized on the same reward mechanisms in the brain that are activated by in-person social interactions, albeit potentially less intensely. This can create a cycle where individuals turn to these platforms for social connection or emotional regulation, even when the experience is ultimately unsatisfying or harmful.

Dr. Kay Tye hypothesizes that social media interactions may not be as effective in combating loneliness as real-time, synchronous interactions. The asynchronous nature of most social media communication lacks the interbrain synchrony that occurs during in-person interactions, which may be crucial for meaningful social contact.

For both gambling and social media, there's a risk of these activities becoming compulsive behaviors that individuals turn to when feeling lonely or anxious. Dr. Haidt notes that as young people have moved their social lives online, many have become lonelier, seeking "cheap and easy stimulation" that ultimately doesn't satisfy their social needs.

In conclusion, while gambling and social media operate through different mechanisms, both can significantly impact emotions and contribute to feelings of loneliness. They can create cycles of temporary relief followed by increased negative emotions, potentially leading to addiction-like behaviors. The key difference seems to be that while gambling is more clearly recognized as potentially harmful, social media's effects are more pervasive and sometimes less obvious, affecting how people, especially young individuals, perceive themselves and interact with others.

and I think frankly for many older people too is their experience on social media has shredded their self-esteem as they constantly comparing themselves to other people like when you and I were growing up uh you know in the ' 80s we we compared ourselves to other people too right people have from Millennia but what's fundamentally different now is that in a given day you can compare yourself to thousands of images that you see online that's actually literally what people young people tell me I do roundtables with college students and high school students all the time around the country

is a great masquerader it can look like withdrawal and sadness it can look like anger and irritability it can look like aloofness as well and so it's only when we stop to ask someone how they're doing

Ground Truths: ['Gambling and social media can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and negative emotions. For gamblers, the addiction can lead to a cycle of shame and despair, as they believe that the next gamble could change everything, which creates a false sense of hope. Similarly, when individuals, particularly boys and girls, shift their social lives to video games, porn, and social media, they may experience loneliness despite receiving cheap and easy stimulation, which ultimately is not satisfying.']

Answer: <thinking>
The question asks about laws protecting against child neglect claims for unsupervised outdoor play. I'll need to analyze the context for any mention of such laws, focusing on the parts that discuss legal protections for allowing children to play independently. The most relevant information appears to be in the first document, which mentions an organization called "Let Grow" and their efforts to pass laws in several states.
</thinking>

There are laws in place in some states that protect parents from child neglect claims when they allow their children to engage in unsupervised outdoor play. An organization called Let Grow, co-founded by Jonathan Haidt and Lenore Skenazy, has been advocating for the return of independent play for children. As a result of their efforts, eight states have passed laws that specifically address this issue.

These laws state that allowing a child to play outside unsupervised cannot be used as evidence of child neglect. This is significant because, in the past, ambiguous laws have led to situations where parents faced potential legal consequences for letting their children play independently.

For example, if a parent sent their 8-year-old child to a store alone, and a concerned neighbor called the police, it could potentially escalate to involvement with Child Protective Services. These new laws aim to prevent such scenarios and protect parents who choose to give their children more independence.

It's important to note that these laws are not universal across the United States. They have been passed in eight states, but the specific states are not mentioned in the provided context. Parents should be aware of the laws in their particular state regarding unsupervised play and child neglect definitions.

The goal of these laws is to stop the incentivization of helicopter parenting and to provide more safe spaces for children to play independently. This legal approach is part of a broader effort to restore play-based childhood experiences in the real world, which are seen as crucial for healthy child development.

where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "whatever but um but kids need to be out playing with each other especially Outdoors we evolved in savanas we evolved in different parts of the world we're attracted to Nature um so that's the way it it always was now uh especially if we in the 1950s and 60s America just been through a World War and the greatest way to make people trust each other the greatest way to boost social capital is a foreign attack and of course Pearl Harbor did more for American Co coherence than anything else in history in modern history 911 did that too but only for a little while and then we we lost it um so for a a lot of reasons people trusted their neighbors kids were out playing you know my parents grew up in the depression in New York City the kids were all out playing stickball on the street or in a parking lot in the 1970s there is a real crime wave um crime goes through the roof actually and it goes through the 80s that goes all the way to the early 90s even still you were kicked out of the house to go play um even in New York City all kids went out to play that's just the way it was but we begin to lose trust in each other for a lot of reasons Robert putam wrote about this in Bowling alone the the the the loss of Social Capital many reasons for that the changing media environment air conditioning and television people are not hanging out on their porch in the summertime to get away from the Heat they Clos the door and they put on the AC and they watch TV family sizes are shrinking there are not that many kids around so for a lot of reasons by the the 90s is the key decade where act two of the tragedy happens and that's the loss of the play-based childhood", "most Instagram no so it the the huge time suck is the videos so it's actually Tik Tok and YouTube are counted in this analysis they're counted as social media YouTube is marginally social media it's more of an general information Source but the point is especially the short videos the short videos are really really addictive because the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the house every day to go play my mom would say get out of the house I now realize she wanted space yeah", "but we just need a norm now for for raising the age to 16 we can struggle to do that I'm doing that with my kids I'm saying no for my daughter no Snapchat till you're 16 16 um and she's the only one who doesn't have it it's painful for her and she's 14 um but my hope is that no parent again will be in that situation that in every school a lot of the parents are going to say no no social media till 16 now of course the laws currently state that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract give away your data and make a deal with a company without your parents knowledge or permission but Congress passed this terrible law in 1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy protection act it was supposed to set the age to 16 which is not which is I think pretty reasonable but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement it's the law is written such that as long as the company doesn't absolutely know that you're underage they're fine they're not responsible 13 they're motivated the companies are now the law motivates the companies to not know how old children are there's barely any forbrain at 13 that's right that's right and since all you have to do you just have to be old enough to lie about your age if you're old enough to lie about your age you can go anywhere on the internet because there's no enforcement so I'm saying let's take the age of 13 which is not enforced let's require age verification which is complicated but they're working on that in Britain they've they're mandating that it's going to happen in Britain we'll work out the technical details um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's the one place where I think we really do need law uh because social media is a social trap and if half the kids are on it there's going to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws", "I love what your mom did getting you guys outside um my parents did the same thing too like we I was very blessed to have two parents who didn't come you know they didn't have a lot of resources growing up they didn't come to this country with a lot of

the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out", "so in America and Britain we freaked out about child abduction and child sexual abuse um some of the scandals were real the Boy Scouts the Catholic Church there were cases where trusted organizations were covering up abuse and I recall the abduction thing the carton y thing right and there was a show I think my name is Brian you know about the kid who was abducted and then all he remembered I think it's a true story was that his name was Brian he would just remind himself every night about his real name you know I think they found him eventually in Berkeley mhm not calling out Berkeley I lived in Berkeley for a long time but um seemed to be the discovery of of Abu of abducted kid excuse me in Berkeley uh there are a few other cases there I don't know what that's about um in any of I grew up thinking that you could get kidnapped right yeah which yeah which is so it's I mean it's the most terrifying possibility for any parent um but when I was doing the research for the codling the American mind I found according to FBI statistics there's only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings a year in our whole country because if a child like who would take a child like it's a really difficult crime and you're going to you know who would steal a child from a store you know parents are afraid if your kid goes to the next D on the grocery store going to be how are you going to take a kicking and screaming kid out of a store um it's and yet sorry to interrupt but the show America's Most Wanted I believe was hosted by a guy whose kid was abducted and eventually found dead exactly Adam that's right right so so there was this propagation of this fear like that one of the deepest fears of any parent I can to imagine is is is that that's right but the point is that these crimes are extraordinarily rare it's almost always the non-custodial parent who takes a kid it's a family member because there's a fight within the family um so we fear the wrong things we're terrified of kidnapping um but locking our kids up overprotecting them has spiked the suicide rate so much that the death toll is vastly higher from the extra suicides than it would be if we could completely wipe out kidnapping which again doesn't", "so that's the third Norm is uh no uh is phonefree schools you have to lock up the phone in the morning either a lock in a phone lock or Yonder pouch um if the policy is you keep in your pocket that's not a policy that's just a recipe for constant conflict with the kids because they can't help it they have to text if anyone's texting they have to be texting and the fourth Norm is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real world because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing we have to do is restore a really fun adventurous childhood like you know what you were saying you know you go out on your bicycle you're hanging out with your friends friends sometimes something happens and boy you have memories I mean exciting things happen scary things happen you have memories and you know I worry about like what you know what boys today you know I have a group of Buddy my group of friends that I you know we we still talk about things that happened you know things that amazing things that happened when we were in college or after college and I wonder what boys young boys today are going to say you know you remember fortnite game 27363 where you were trapped in that Elevator Shaft and I had to shoot you out no I don't remember that one you know like uh the the virtual Adventures are just not going to cut it our kids need Adventure they need Independence and Adventure uh where they work out the conflicts themselves"]

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll focus on the key points from the context about mental health trends for girls since the early 2010s. The main aspects to cover are:
1. The sharp increase in mental health issues starting around 2012
2. The specific mental health problems that have increased
3. The magnitude of the increase
4. How this trend compares to boys
5. The potential causes mentioned, particularly related to smartphones and social media
</thinking>

Since the early 2010s, there have been significant changes in mental health trends for girls. The most notable shift occurred around 2012, when there was a sudden and dramatic increase in various mental health issues among girls. This change has been described as a "hockey stick" pattern, with a sharp upward turn in the data.

The main mental health problems that have seen a substantial increase include:
1. Depression
2. Anxiety
3. Self-harm

The magnitude of this increase is quite significant. According to the information provided, most measures show increases in the range of 50% to 150%, with some nearly doubling. This is not a subtle change but a major shift in mental health patterns for girls.

Interestingly, while boys have also experienced increases in depression and anxiety, the pattern for them is different. The increase for boys began slightly earlier (around 2009-2010) and has been more gradual, without the sharp uptick seen in girls' data.

This trend is not limited to self-reported data. Similar patterns have been observed in more objective measures, such as hospital admissions for self-harm and psychiatric emergency department visits. This trend is also not confined to a single country but has been observed across many developed nations, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Scandinavian countries.

The context strongly suggests that the rise of smartphones and social media may be a significant factor in this trend. The timing of the increase coincides with the widespread adoption of smartphones and social media platforms. The impact on girls seems to be particularly pronounced, possibly due to the nature of their social interactions online and the heightened use of these technologies.

It's important to note that while this trend is concerning, it's part of a complex picture of mental health, and individual cases can have many contributing factors. However, the widespread nature of this change across different countries and its correlation with smartphone adoption make it a significant area of concern and study.

2012 in other countries but the girls graphs are very sharp the boys are also up on depression anxiety they're also way up depending on the measure it's usually everything is in the ballpark of 50 to 150% almost all the numbers are in that range um we're not talking 10 or 20% increases here for most things we're talking close to a doubling especially for the younger girls the boys curves interestingly are smoother that is the boys are more depressed and anxious it's but it's not 2012 it it actually often begins begins more like 2009 2010 and then it just keeps going up gradually so that that's a real clue um which we'll come back when we talk about the the boy story um it a lot of people say oh you know it's just self-report um you know just gen Z they're really they're really

mental health in particular in girls yeah so feel free to hit us with the with the scary truth okay sure so let's imagine so in the US we have really good statistics based on annual or biannual surveys there's three or four big ones that allow us to see what's happened since the 70s and so what I'd like listeners to imagine is imagine a bunch of lines maybe a line for boys maybe a line a line for boys line for girls showing the percentage that suffer from anxiety depression or that have self harm those three really go together and imagine these lines they move around a little bit but they're actually pretty stable from the 1990s all the way through 2010 even 2011 there's no sign of a problem on some measures they're getting actually a little bit better because stable and low stable well low you know if it's if they're around say 12 15 % of girls qualify as having had a major depression you know that's much higher than we would like um that's a problem", "but the fact that we see the exact same curves the very sharp uptick for girls um in Hospital admissions for self harm psychiatric emergency Department visits and we see this in the US Canada Australia New Zealand uh the UK um the Scandinavian countries so something happened across the developed World um around 2012 and I keep you know Jee twangy was the first to really raise the alarm she and I keep saying well you know we can't find another candidate nothing else fits the pattern oh and there's actually not just correlational data there's experiment experimental data too", "so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "but there's this whole category of jokes like um you know when joaco was born um the doctor looked at his mother and said it's a man you know or or when jao left for college he looked at his father and said you're the man of the house now you know jokes like that you know there are tons and tons of these right so there's this whole so that's very YouTube male type humor it's it's one hit it's done it gets a ton of likes and it propagates yeah none of this two or three chess moves down the down the road um so it's very clapback sometimes in or in that case building up Joo who doesn't need any more building up but people do it anyway so things of that sort so interested in the in these um in the Nuance here because um you're telling me that girls are killing themselves more they're depressed their increase in suicide is larger boys have a much higher suicide rate so boy many more boys die from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or a bridge whereas girls tend to use pills or cutting their wrists and they and the great majority of girl suicide attempts don't lead to death yeah so are most of the issues with girls and online use social media it's sort of um uh it's despair it's at home anxious sad about self self- critiquing this kind of thing I mean you're telling me there's a a huge and I believe you that there's a tremendous increase I mean he said hockey stick like function um when we're looking at essentially capturing the tip of the p pyramid in terms of like extreme social interaction so take let me I'm not being very very clear here we have these neural circuits that evolved for social interactions that are more heightened in girls they're getting much more of it faster yeah and the consequences are no less and probably even more severe than they used to be"]

Ground Truths: ['Since the early 2010s, the mental health trends for girls have shown a significant increase in anxiety, depression, and self-harm. Specifically, around 2012, the percentage of girls suffering from these issues sharply rose, resembling a hockey stick curve, indicating a dramatic change compared to the stable rates observed from the 1990s to 2010. This increase is described as not subtle, with many measures showing close to a doubling of these mental health issues, particularly among younger girls.']

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I need to:
1. Identify the age set by COPPA for minors in contracts and data sharing
2. Explain how this aligns with current views on kids' social media access
3. Discuss any discrepancies or issues with the current age limit
4. Relate this to modern concerns about children's social media use
5. Provide relevant information from the context about proposed changes or recommendations
</thinking>

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) set the age for minors in contracts and data sharing at 13. This law was passed in 1998 and was originally intended to set the age at 16, which was considered more reasonable. However, it was pushed down to 13 with little enforcement.

This age limit of 13 does not align well with today's views on kids' social media access. Many experts and parents now believe that 13 is too young for unrestricted social media use. The law's current form motivates companies to avoid knowing children's actual ages, as they are not held responsible if they don't "absolutely know" a user is underage.

There are several issues with the current age limit:

1. Lack of enforcement: The law is written such that companies are not responsible as long as they don't definitively know a user is underage.
2. Ease of circumvention: Children can easily lie about their age to access social media platforms.
3. Developmental concerns: At 13, the prefrontal cortex is still developing, making children more vulnerable to the negative effects of social media.

Modern concerns about children's social media use focus on mental health impacts, privacy issues, and the potential for manipulation by large tech companies. Many experts, including Dr. Jonathan Haidt, are advocating for raising the age limit to 16 for social media access.

Recommendations for addressing these concerns include:

1. Raising the age limit to 16 for social media access.
2. Implementing stronger age verification methods.
3. Enforcing the age limit more strictly.
4. Creating social norms around delaying smartphone and social media access for children.

These recommendations aim to protect children during critical developmental periods and address the collective action problem where parents feel pressured to allow earlier access because "everyone else is doing it."

Cino to keep them in don't have a clock don't let them see what time it is keep them in don't let them click over to a link to another site keep them in um we somehow have seeded our children's childhood to Giant companies that have shown that they don't really care about our kids welfare they care much more about profitability and and they care about their customers who are the advertisers and these companies have been granted a special RIT from the King Congress said in in in the in section 230 of the communications decency act in 1996 I think it was Congress said oh and nobody sue you nobody can sue you for what you show to their kids uh there was a reason for that that you don't want AOL to be responsible for everything anyone posts but it's been so broadly interpreted that so far any attempt to regulate social media or any attempt to sue them is seen as like no no", "so I think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here too cuz Andrew my big concern with parents is look we've taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which we didn't grow up with as kids and we've told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this um you know when we were growing up you remember the motor vehicle fatalities were really high uh in America and we didn't say okay you know what that's just the price of Modern Life we just have to accept it and keep moving on with our lives we said hold on we don't have to go back to horses and Buggies but we also don't need to accept this death rate we need to make this experience safer and so we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups like Matt and others across the country that me Mothers Against Drunk Driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts airbags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that help helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents and deaths and that's what we need here too like we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting in place safety standards to protect kids from exposure to harmful content from from the experience of bullying and harassment and that also protect them from features that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use uh which is happening far too often right now we also need a policy that requires data transparency from the company you know researchers tell us all the time that they these are independent researchers they tell us they are having a hard time getting full access to the data from the social media platforms about the full impact of the platforms on the mental health of kids and as a parent look I I don't when we bought car seats for my children when when they were born we looked up the safety data like many parents we wanted to make sure the car seats were safe but if you had told me that hey you know the manufacturers of these car seats are actually not disclosing some of the the data on the impact on children uh but go ahead and buy it anyway", "oh these terrible devices um rather it's about a vision of childhood which is actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the reason why I got this far is because it's a set of collective action traps everyone every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone so the four recommendations I have are four ways of breaking out on the Trap but the first two are really about delaying and getting past this period of plasticity and you really help me see why it's so urgent to delay until late puberty at least so here are the four Norms that I think can break us out of this trap Norm number one uh no smartphone before high school you can give your kid a flip phone flip the Millennials had flip phones they came out fine no access or no smartphone of their own your own you can't have your own and that would even go for an iPad if you give your kid an iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it any you know anywhere in the house and you can take it outside even although maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the point is um the internet is an amazing thing and you know you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids and they can do things on the computer but you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to so it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone let them have a flip phone or a simple phone watch something like that that's rule number one rule number two is the most relevant for what we're just talking about and that is no social media until 16 there is I believe no way to make social media safe for children that is if they're going to be entering a domain in which Prestige is gained by having posts that get the most likes and followers you're making them be brand managers you're making them be performative this is not playful th", 'So,\n- Right.', "It's like-\n- Right. - Well-\n-", 'Like so-\n-', "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep

children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts

Answer: <thinking>
To answer this question, I'll need to focus on information related to boys' mental health and neural circuits from a neurobiological perspective. The context provides some relevant information, particularly about neural circuits related to sex and violence in boys, as well as general information about adolescent brain development. I'll need to synthesize this information to provide insights on boys' mental health from a neurobiological standpoint.
</thinking>

Neurobiologists provide several insights into boys' mental health regarding neural circuits:

1. Heightened circuits for sex and violence: In boys, neural circuits related to sex and violence are particularly heightened. These circuits have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years and play a significant role in boys' behavior and mental processes.

2. Increased connectivity during puberty: During puberty, there's increased connectivity between different brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex (involved in motivation and decision-making), dopamine centers, and the amygdala. This integration allows for testing of circuits related to emotions and rewards as they pertain to decision-making.

3. Testing of social and physical interactions: The increased connectivity in adolescent brains leads to testing of social and physical interactions. This can sometimes result in unsafe behavior, as teens explore how different actions lead to success, fear states, or other outcomes.

4. Dopamine and emotion: There's a connection between dopamine centers in the brain and areas involved in emotion and dispersal. This relationship is particularly important during adolescence and puberty, potentially influencing boys' emotional experiences and behaviors.

5. Potential for circuit hyperactivity: While not specific to boys, research on bipolar disorder suggests that early hyperactivity in certain neural circuits can lead to diminished activity in those same circuits later in life. This highlights the complex nature of brain development and the potential long-term effects of early neural circuit activity.

It's important to note that while these insights provide a neurobiological perspective on boys' mental health, they don't paint a complete picture. The research presented is often general to adolescents or focused on specific conditions like bipolar disorder. More targeted research on boys' mental health and neural circuits would be needed for a more comprehensive understanding.

listening.\n\nThe reality is that people with bipolar depression very likely have a hyperactivity, that is an increased level of activity in certain circuits within the brain early in the expression of their disease.\n\nAnd that typically, as\nI mentioned earlier, sets in around the early\n20s, although sometimes that can be even earlier,\nin the teens and so forth.\n\nBut that hyperactivity, we think, leads to a toxicity and excitotoxicity of certain elements of the neural circuits that are responsible for interoception.\n\nIn other words, the overuse of certain\ncircuits can lead to a diminishing, an atrophy, or even a death of certain elements within those circuits and it appears that lithium, through its anti-inflammatory\nand neuroprotective effects and through its ability to increase BDNF, very likely protects us against some of that atrophy of those\ncircuits for interoception."]

Ground Truths: ['Neurobiologists provide insights that the neural circuits related to sex and violence in boys have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years and are heightened, leading to more severe consequences in behavior and interactions. They suggest that the underlying issues, akin to an iceberg, are not being addressed, and the effects of these neural circuits are becoming more potent and rapid.']

Answer: 

The relationship between myopia (nearsightedness) and screen time in children is complex and multifaceted. While there is a correlation between increased screen time and the development of myopia in children, recent research suggests that the relationship may not be as straightforward as previously thought.

Traditionally, it was believed that excessive near work, such as reading or using computers and smartphones, was the primary cause of myopia in children. Studies showed that children who spent more time on near activities were more likely to develop nearsightedness. This was particularly evident in Asian populations, where myopia has been described as an epidemic.

However, recent studies have revealed that the issue may be more related to the type of light exposure children receive rather than just near work alone. Spending time outdoors in natural sunlight appears to be a crucial factor in preventing or slowing the progression of myopia. Full-spectrum light from the sun seems to play a significant role in proper eye development.

One study published in the journal Ophthalmology in 2018 found that children who spent about 11 hours per week (or roughly 2 hours per day) outdoors had a significantly reduced probability of developing nearsightedness. This outdoor time doesn't necessarily mean avoiding all near activities; children can still read or engage in other activities outside.

The increase in myopia rates among children is likely due to a combination of factors:
1. Increased screen time and near work
2. Reduced time spent outdoors in natural light
3. Changes in lifestyle and educational demands

To help prevent or slow the progression of myopia in children, the following recommendations can be drawn from the research:
1. Encourage children to spend at least 2 hours per day outdoors in natural light
2. Balance screen time and near work with activities that require looking at a distance
3. Create a healthy visual environment that includes both indoor and outdoor activities
4. Consider the quality of light exposure, not just the distance of visual tasks

It's important to note that while these measures can help, they may not completely prevent myopia in all cases, as there are also genetic factors involved in its development.

how myopic are they how nearsighted are they versus how much time is your kid in front of the computer doing near work how myopic or nearsighted are they and these well-designed cohort studies did

closed than I ever would be with both eyes maybe that's true for most people question I have is is it true that even just a few hours of misalignment of information to the two eyes early in development can permanently rewire the brain unless there are some corrective measures such as patching up one eye and the example I gave is just one but for instance if um uh you know someone injures you know gives a scratch on their cornea and they close they patch the eye and the person happens to be 10 years old is it important to then patch the other healthy eye after the the um you know the scratched eye is feeling better in other words how critical is it to ensure the balance of information coming into the two eyes even on the order of hours or days yeah your story is uh it has some features of uh you know totally usual how we think about misaligned eyes leading to amblyopia where one eye is weaker patching the strong eye so the weak eye can recover but not necessarily fully regaining depth perception and so that part of it is you know quite stereotypical the part of your story that's atypical is that for most kids um an hour to let alone minutes an hour to even an hour to a day if you were I don't know if you were a young kid and you just really were training up on throwing darts and you were just keeping one eye closed to throw the darts you know really practicing for an hour a day it'd be very unusual for that to trigger this kind of either strabismus misalignment of the eyes let alone amblyopia and the strabismus is what's giving you the double vision because they're misaligned let alone the amblyopia of one eye turning out weaker if I had to guess of course not having you know done your exam before that fateful day in the swimming pool if I had to guess I would guess that you may have had some intermittent business and your brain was already getting kind of hit and and you neither you nor your parents may have even noticed it it could be happening you know at other times a day or you're not kind of really paying attention it doesn't kind of stand out in the way that that that day that you got out of the swimming pool you really noticed it and it may not have been that strong it may have been quite intermittent but if you had had some years of intermittent isotropia or turning in of the eyes or exotropia turning out of the eyes that just happened here and there but was accumulating sort of uh damage or failure to connect over years leading up to that day in the swimming pool and that day just tipped you over the edge and you've got double vision you really noticed it that led to an eye exam and an eye care provider and they said wait a second this size stronger this size weaker you've got a little amblyopia we're going to start patching your strong eyes so you can get your weak eye back so for 99.9 percent of the kids who like you know yeah they get a little corneal scratch or they're patching one eye closed or or uh you know anything that's sort of a rare event like that nothing to worry about parents don't have to worry kids can be kids they can play they can do that kind of thing and uh and not have to worry and and it's unfortunate that we can't tell in advance which kid's been having the intermittent amblyopia because we don't do a standard eye exam on every five-year-old who's not complaining of anything

close range that the eyeball lengthens and therefore the visual image Falls in front of and not directly onto the neural retina the essentially the light sensing portion of the of the eye and those animals become myopic or nearsighted what can we say about the environmental conditions in which kids are seeing from the time they're born through let's say adolescents and their teen years in terms

you're outside in sunlight even it's in direct sunlight you're getting a different spectrum of kind of Full Spectrum Lighting from the sun and it looks like it's pretty clear now actually that it has maybe more to do with outdoor lighting time than just near work and so I think that you know we we've we've actually already seen the first couple randomized controlled trials where they're having kids intentionally spending time Outdoors versus sort of Standard Life which you know is going to be often much more indoor time and uh and seeing some effects you follow those kids over a couple of years and the kids who spend time Outdoors are are progressing in their nearsightedness less like they're they're nearsighted prescription is not getting as strong as the kid kids who are spending more time indoors and there's some pretty good biology that's getting worked out going back to animal models more about about how that might be working in the retina in this inside the eye but it's pretty compelling uh concept and and so you know as a parent uh you you may want to be you may want to be telling your kid like okay yeah I want you to read that book or you know if your kids plan on the phone or something like that or the iPad or something like that they're allowed that time okay you can have that time", "In any case, the social media and staring at a small visual aperture is

Answer: 

Dopamine overshoot has significant negative impacts on individuals addicted to activities like gambling or video games. This phenomenon leads to a progressive narrowing of the things that bring pleasure to the addicted individual. As a result, they often lose interest in other aspects of life such as school, relationships, fitness, and overall well-being.

For video game addicts, the initial excitement and pleasure from playing gradually diminish. They may continue playing excessively, but the dopamine release becomes less intense over time. This can lead to a severe situation where the individual only achieves significant dopamine release from gaming, neglecting other activities and responsibilities.

In the case of gambling addiction, the dopamine overshoot creates a particularly dangerous cycle. Gamblers experience a surge of dopamine not just during the act of gambling, but also in anticipation of potential wins. This creates a powerful motivational drive, causing them to return to gambling repeatedly, even when it's detrimental to their lives. The hope and anticipation associated with gambling leverage the dopamine system so effectively that people may continue despite significant losses and negative consequences.

For both video game and gambling addicts, there's a risk of developing tolerance, where they need increasingly more engagement with the addictive behavior to achieve the same level of dopamine release. This can result in a vicious cycle where the individual spends more and more time on the addictive activity, further neglecting other aspects of their life.

Eventually, even the addictive behavior may stop providing sufficient dopamine release, potentially leading to a serious depression. In extreme cases, this pattern of addiction and subsequent dopamine depletion can become so severe that individuals have been known to contemplate or commit suicide.

It's important to note that the impact of dopamine overshoot can vary between individuals. Some people may experience a much higher increase in dopamine release from these activities than others, which could explain why certain individuals are more susceptible to developing these addictions.

Overall, dopamine overshoot in gambling and video game addiction can lead to a significant deterioration in an individual's quality of life, mental health, and ability to find pleasure in other activities, potentially resulting in severe depression and other serious consequences.

aside it's still important but let's just say this you don't have to think about any of those details or names or anything let's just think about addiction because in biology and in Psychology frankly it really often pays to think about the extremes first and then work our way towards more typical circumstances and with that said addiction unfortunately is very common nowadays I just heard a statistic in fact that there is an 8080 percent increase in alcohol use disorder among women in the last 30 years I talked a little bit about this in the episode that I did about alcohol and health again I want to be very clear I'm not somebody that is completely against alcohol for adults provided they're not alcoholics turns out two drinks a week probably fine health-wise zero would be better if we're honest zero is better than any alcohol but two drinks a week is probably fine past two drinks you start running into problems and yet many many people out there male and female alike suffer from alcohol use disorder also called alcoholism the same is also true for things like methamphetamine or cocaine or other types of substance addictions and the same is also true for a lot of Behavioral or what are sometimes called process addictions things like sex addiction or video game addiction or any type of behavior that frankly is leveraging the dopamine system but that engages this Progressive narrowing of the things that bring someone pleasure such that nothing else is really Salient nothing else is really pulling them in in the way that they're video games or sex or pornography or alcohol pick your substance or you know behavior that you see out there or hopefully not but that you might suffer from an addiction too so what's happening in addiction well addiction involves dopamine among other things often the opioid system Etc", "well then we consider it adaptive if it's not well then considered maladaptive some people will sit down to play a video game they really like video games and as they're sitting down they will experience a five-fold increase in the rate of dopamine output from their nucleus accumbens for other people it's going to be a tenfold increase for other people like me who don't like video games very much I don't have anything against them I don't dislike them but it doesn't do much for me it might not cause any increase whatsoever it might even cause a decrease in dopamine so there's a lot of individual variability for sex it turns out to be a range so the typical range that's cited in the literature is anywhere from a four to five-fold increase in the rate of dopamine neuron firing however there are certain individuals for which that number is doubled caffeine is a little bit of a special circumstance because caffeine has the property of not just causing the release of dopamine but increasing the amount of dopamine receptors over time and there aren't a lot of excellent measurements of the amount of dopamine released as a function of caffeine intake in different populations of humans it's mostly animal studies but what we think based on the Gestalt based on the overall picture of the literature is that it's an approximate doubling of the dopamine signaling that's coming out of the VTA nucleus accumens to prefrontal Cortex when we anticipate and when we drink our coffee again I really want to be clear that for all of these things these are relative levels and they are distribution so if we were to plot them out on paper you would see that these are not bar graphs these are overlapping curves to some extent so some people are going to achieve more dopamine release or less dopamine release from one Behavior or substance however it's very clear that cocaine methamphetamine even heroin for that matter are way out on the right hand side of the curve causing enormous increases in dopamine very quickly and the other things that we described have again a distribution that is more leftward shifted on this imaginary plot that I'm creating it's a lot of individual variability however it's fascinating that dopamine is the single molecule that's causing the craving and pursuit and experience of all of these substances and behaviors and the learning of all of that craving Pursuit and actual experience is what predicts whether or not we will re-engage reuse that substance or not re-engage in a behavior or not and how frequently we will do that so that's addiction but if you understand how the height of those peaks in dopamine and the rate to reach those Peaks and the troughs that result and how long the troughs take to get back to Baseline if you understand or a little or all of that you're really in a terrific position to understand how to Leverage The dopamine system for the pursuit of healthy goals and behaviors I should mention one thing about recovery from addiction which is that the reset of all that dopamine circuitry from unhealthy to healthy often involves depending on the addiction 30 days of complete abstinence that 30 days of complete abstinence inevitably involves a lot of pain and discomfort and craving anxiety insomnia Etc that relates to the big trough in dopamine that inevitably occurs now of course there are some addictions such as severe alcohol addiction and in some cases opiate addiction that immediate and sustained abstinence cannot be used as the tool somebody really needs to work with an addiction specialist and sometimes there needs to be a tapering off of the substance for other addictions it can be quote unquote cold turkey and then of course there are other addictions particularly food and sex but sometimes even things like video games for which the desired outcome is not necessarily to eliminate the behavior completely but to set some constraints around the behavior so that it's not occurring to the exclusion of other pleasureful things in life and adaptive things in life and for that there is the requirement for what are called binding behaviors we'll get back to binding behaviors later but binding behaviors or behaviors in which people bind their behavior around a particular substance use or around a particular behavioral addiction like sex Video Games Etc in space and or time in space meaning they might only engage in those particular behaviors in certain places and certain times when it's context appropriate there are numerous examples of binding behaviors in space and time it all has to do with clamping or directing when the engagement with the dopamine releasing behavior is going to occur so what's happening when people decide to go cold turkey or they use these binding behaviors well what's happening is that people are engaging the specific circuitry within the prefrontal cortex that as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode are important for context setting so in the cases of binding behaviors the prefrontal cortex is essentially getting trained up to understand that okay certain things like food or perhaps sex or perhaps video games they're okay if they are done or consumed in appropriate amounts or in particular context that requires the context setting goal directed behavior that the prefrontal cortex is responsible", "Now, there are reasons why you would have brain circuitry like this.\n\nI mean, brain circuitry like this didn't evolve\nto get you addicted brain circuitry like this evolved in order to motivate behaviors toward particular goals, water when you're thirsty , sex in order to reproduce and we're gonna talk\nabout the relationship between estrogen and testosterone\nand the dopamine system because those hormones actually bias dopamine to be released.\n\nThese things and these\nbrain areas in neurons were part of the\nevolutionary history that led to the continuation of our species.\n\nThings like cocaine and\namphetamine are disastrous for most people because\nthey really so much dopamine and they create these\nclosed loops where people then only crave the particular\nthing, cocaine, amphetamine that leads to those massive\namounts of dopamine release.\n\nMost things don't release\nthat level of dopamine.\n\nNow, nowadays there's a ton of interest in social\nmedia and in video games and there have been some measurements of the amount of dopamine\nreleased video games especially video games\nhave a very high update speed where there's novel\nterritory all the time not novelty is a big stimulus of dopamine.\n\nThose can release dopamine somewhere between nicotine and cocaine.\n\nSo very high levels of dopamine release.", "so there's a lot going on going on here um for some for some of them they are addicted and they feel bad for the reasons you were talking about dopamine overshoot or they feel bad when they're not doing the addictive activity so they are compulsively using it just like a a gambler if you're addicted to slot machines your life sucks you've spent all your family's money you're ashamed of what happened you feel terrible oh but if I just get back into the Zone on the slot machine I feel good for that two or three hours that's the most dangerous addiction cuz as it's been described to me I'm fortunately not a gambling addict addict excuse me the Gambler really does believe that the next one could change everything right it's going to it's going to cause motivated reasoning it's going to cause hopefulness that is dashed um so for some of them it is a kind of self-medication as soon as the boys move their social lives onto video games and porn and the girls move their social Liv on social media both sexes got really lonely um it's you know they're getting lots of cheap and easy stimulation but it's not satisfying so what do they do now that they're lonely and anxious", "Here's the thing, when dopamine is higher\nin your brain and body, when you've deployed it through excitement or pharmacology or otherwise, it tends to narrow your focus\nand make you seek more of it in that general theme that\nyou happen to be focused on.\n\nIt could be anything.\n\nThat's the scary thing about dopamine.\n\nWhat can you do to control\nit and to reduce it?\n\nWell, for those of you\nthat are engaging in habits that are healthy, maybe that doesn't\nrequire reducing dopamine.\n\nHow do you define\nhealthy versus unhealthy?\n\nWell, I think the simplest\nway to define addiction, at least by my mind, is that addiction is a\nprogressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure.\n\nAnd a good life is a progressive expansion of the things that bring you pleasure.\n\nA rather simple definition, and yet when we think about\nthe biology of dopamine, dopamine is not unique to one pursuit.\n\nIt's not unique to the pursuit of sex or the pursuit of warmth when you're cold or cool environments when you're too warm or food or social media, it's just a dumb molecule that puts you into this forward state of\nmass, small visual aperture, and a kind of obsessive-like nature.\n\nWhat can you do to counter that?", "So today we've talked a lot\nabout the dopamine system and those kinds of schedules\nthat will allow craving or addiction, but what's\nthe schedule of dopamine.\n\nThat's going to allow you to maximize on your pursuit of pleasure\nand your elimination of pain.\n\nAnd we get the answer to that from our good friend gambling,\nthe reason gambling works the reason why people will\nthrow their lives away.\n\nThe reason why people go back\nagain and again and again to places like Las Vegas\nand Atlantic city is because of the hope and anticipation it's as those are cities in\nplaces built on dopamine, they are leveraging your dopamine system.\n\nAnd I realized that there\nare experienced gamblers.\n\nThere are people that enjoy gambling.\n\nI'll actually just say, I like sitting at the roulette table.\n\nI was take a designated amount of money.\n\nIt's not much, I enjoy playing\na little bit of roulette.\n\nI certainly enjoy when I win.\n\nI certainly don't like it when I lose but I do it cheerly for\nthe pleasure of playing.\n\nAnd I do it very seldom.\n\nI don't have a gambling problem.\n\nAnd if I did, I'd probably tell you but I don't have a gambling problem."]

Ground Truths: ['Dopamine overshoot can lead individuals who are addicted to activities like gambling or video games to feel bad when they are not engaging in those activities. This results in compulsive use, as they seek the temporary relief and pleasure that these activities provide, despite the negative consequences in their lives.']

Answer: 

AG1, a nutritional supplement, is designed to support various aspects of well-being related to both mental and physical health. According to information from the Huberman Lab podcast, AG1 provides foundational nutrition that aims to enhance overall well-being in several key areas.

For mental health, AG1 is reported to support:
1. Energy levels
2. Stress management (through adaptogens)
3. Overall mental health and performance

In terms of physical health, AG1 is said to support:
1. Digestion
2. Sleep quality
3. Physical health and performance
4. Skin health (indirectly, as it's mentioned in one of the video titles)

AG1 achieves these benefits by providing a comprehensive blend of:
- Vitamins
- Minerals
- Probiotics
- Fiber
- Adaptogens

The supplement is described as a "nutritional insurance policy" that helps ensure optimal intake of these essential nutrients. It's important to note that AG1 is designed to augment, not replace, a healthy diet. Many users report feeling better in various ways after taking AG1 regularly.

While AG1 is marketed as supporting all aspects of well-being related to mental and physical health, it's worth noting that the specific mechanisms or clinical studies supporting these claims are not detailed in the provided information. The benefits described are largely based on user reports and the general understanding of the importance of comprehensive nutrition for overall health.

Answer: 

From a neurobiological perspective, the issues related to boys and their mental health are complex and multifaceted. Neurobiologists focus on the neural circuits related to sex and violence, which have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years. In boys, these circuits are particularly heightened and sensitive.

Modern technology, especially smartphones and social media, has created a "super stimulus" environment for these neural circuits. This is analogous to how junk food acts as a super stimulus for our reward systems. For boys, this often manifests in exposure to extreme content related to sex and violence, such as hardcore pornography and violent video games. These stimuli can be incredibly potent and engaging for the male brain, potentially leading to addictive behaviors and difficulties in escaping these patterns.

The impact of this heightened stimulation is significant. Boys are experiencing these intense stimuli at a much faster rate and with more potency than ever before. This can lead to a range of mental health issues, including addiction, anxiety, and depression. While girls also face mental health challenges related to social media use, the specific neural circuits affected in boys make them particularly vulnerable to content related to sex and violence.

Puberty plays a crucial role in this process. During puberty, the brain undergoes profound changes, particularly in areas related to emotion, reward, and decision-making. The hormonal changes during this time, especially the increase in testosterone, further influence brain organization and behavior. This makes adolescence a particularly sensitive period for boys, where exposure to extreme stimuli can have long-lasting effects on mental health and behavior.

It's important to note that while boys have a lower rate of depression and suicide attempts compared to girls, they have a higher rate of completed suicides. This is partly due to the tendency to use more violent means, which is consistent with the heightened neural circuits related to violence.

In conclusion, the neurobiological perspective highlights the unique vulnerabilities of boys' brains to modern technological stimuli, particularly in relation to sex and violence. This understanding can inform approaches to supporting boys' mental health, focusing on managing exposure to extreme content and providing alternative, healthy outlets for these evolved neural circuits.

Ground Truths: ['The neurobiologist perspective highlights that the neural circuits related to sex and violence in boys have evolved over a long period, and there is a concern that the extreme behaviors and interactions are not being adequately addressed. The neurobiologist suggests that the underlying issues, which are more potent and severe, are not being recognized, similar to how junk food acts as a super stimulus, affecting behavior and mental health.']

Answer: 

Based on the information from the Huberman Lab podcast, mental health measures for girls showed remarkable stability from the 1990s through 2011. The data indicates that various mental health indicators, including anxiety, depression, and self-harm, remained relatively constant during this period.

Specifically, it was observed that:

1. The percentage of girls suffering from anxiety, depression, or engaging in self-harm was fairly stable from the 1990s all the way through 2010 and even 2011.

2. While there were some minor fluctuations, the overall trend lines for these mental health measures were described as "pretty flat" until around 2012.

3. In some cases, mental health measures were actually improving slightly during this period. As stated in the podcast, "on some measures they're getting actually a little bit better."

4. The stability was characterized by low prevalence rates. For example, it was mentioned that around 12-15% of girls qualified as having had a major depression during this period, which was considered "stable and low."

It's important to note that this stability was observed not just in the United States but internationally as well. The podcast emphasizes that this pattern of stability held true across multiple developed countries until around 2012, after which significant changes began to occur.

Answer: 

The switch to smartphones significantly altered teen social media use between 2010 and 2015. This period has been referred to as the "Great rewiring of childhood" due to its profound impact on teen behavior and interactions.

In 2010, most teenagers were using flip phones primarily as tools for calling and texting to arrange in-person meetups. Social media platforms at this time were largely web-based and not designed for mobile use.

By 2015, the landscape had dramatically changed. The majority of American teens had smartphones with front-facing cameras and high-speed internet access. This technological shift enabled new patterns of social media use:

1. Increased accessibility: Teens could now access social media platforms anywhere, anytime, leading to much longer periods of engagement. Some reports suggest teens were spending up to 10-15 hours a day on their phones, which was not possible with flip phones.

2. Visual-centric platforms: The introduction of Instagram, which required a smartphone for full functionality, shifted social media use towards more visual content. This was particularly impactful for teenage girls.

3. Constant connectivity: Unlimited texting plans and always-on internet connections meant teens could be in constant communication with peers.

4. New forms of self-expression: Smartphones allowed teens to easily create and share content about themselves, including photos and videos of their activities and appearance.

5. Viral spread of information: The ease of sharing led to faster and wider spread of information among teens, including both positive interactions and potentially harmful content like bullying or risky behaviors.

However, it's important to note that while smartphones facilitated these changes, they weren't inherently problematic. The impacts varied depending on how the technology was used. Some positive effects included increased social support and interaction opportunities. Negative effects included potential for increased bullying, exposure to inappropriate content, and reduced face-to-face social interactions.

It's worth noting that the full impact of this shift is still being studied, particularly regarding how it affects social and physical development of teenagers. More research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of this dramatic change in teen social media use.

risk behavior but it's more the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "so I I point to that it's that 5-year period 2010 to 2015 which I've called the Great rewiring of childhood because it affects everything everything about what children and teenagers are doing I can recall in 2010 I was actually in New York City visiting friends I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting yeah nowadays I think of it less as addicting but almost um like an an OCD of sorts and here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD but the interesting thing about OCD is that the compulsions the behaviors don't serve to reduce the obsessions rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them and in many ways I feel like smartphone use and social media use in particular is a OCD of sorts it's not just habit it's not just an addiction it's an obsessive compulsive Loop so it's already a struggle to pay attention and you know ancient Traditions have have taught techniques to improve your focus your attention we're easily distracted and um you know so I don't work on my phone very much because I I hate to type on the phone and and I'm always at a computer but even for me sitting at my computer as soon as the thinking gets hard as soon as if I'm writing if I'm doing something that requires concentration some little part of my brain says I wonder what the weather's going to be and I go check the weather or you know oh did I get any email I go check my I might check my email you know probably 40 50 times a day and I know that's terrible so the question is is it a compulsion where I feel pulled I have to check it or something bad will happen no it's more like imagine trying to do your work imagine trying to be a kid in school and you have on your desk in front of you you have your television set your record player a walkie talk to talk to your friends a guitar a painting set all array in front of you and your teacher is telling you about you know geometry what are you going to do probably one of these things and so I think the smartphone where a flip phone it's it's a tool you pull it out if you want to talk to someone then you put it away but the smartphone there's no reason to ever put it away talk to us about the scary statistics there's just no way around this yeah", "oh if you're being contacted by strange men around the world who want to have sex with you like that's not good for 11 12 year old girls so it's all these different potential harms and then imagine all these different potential effects S one of which is depression and another is anxiety another is self harm but there's doing worse in school there's becoming more shallow there's uh conflicts with your so there's a whole bunch and then we want to look at the causal connections and what I'm trying to draw out is suppose you we suppose we could quantify the degree to which sheer time just spending five hours a day does that make you more anxious automatically well maybe a little um but that's probably not the main effect so there's a gigantic multicausal network of effects now um I have good numbers for how much the how much teenss are using these devices and these platforms today um Pew in particular did has done a great job of of tracking changes in this since the ear since the 2000s what we know today from both Pew and Gallup is that young people in America are now spending about five hours a day just on social media just social media", "so you can have two parents who are married and living in the same home and may or may not be a good relationship but living in the same home if there's no conflict or that then generally teens will do well or as you're saying there's not necessarily a direct correlation the problem comes in whether parents are living at home together or separated or divorced is if there's conflict and then that conflict tends to result in social issues emotional issues a lot of social anxiety a lot of feeling like I need to do better so that way my parents like me more and we see that with children too that's not just adolescence a lot of depression and with depression can come self-medication and uh self-medicating around other drugs and so on but that generally is resolved if the conflict resolves but as you're saying we're seeing adolescent angst regardless of parenting uh what we really need though it's not a matter of just the divorce or not divorce or the relationship between the parents it's parenting that's important so parents being good monitors being involved in their kids' lives not this oh you're 16 you have a car you can go wherever you want and we're not going to keep an eye on you we still need parents to monitor to pay attention to find out their kids' friends where are they going after school that discretionary time when parents are working and teenagers come home between 3 and 5 or 3 and six tends to be the most risky couple of hours they're it's called discretionary hours where there's no parent around and we don't always know where those teenagers are hanging out so that's more important knowing where their children are and what they're doing and that there's some adult presence some monitoring then whether or not they're still in a relationship my sense is that smartphones have allowed more communication and monitoring between parents and kids but also more interactions between kids and other kids and kids and adults more broadly so is there any evidence that uh the Advent of smartphones is directly creating problems for kids that um has to do with just so much more PE PE to peer interaction or peer to-peer exposure like when I was growing up we didn't have smartphones uh if you did something stupid like that meaning that kids would laugh at it might get told to a small group of people maybe a larger group of people but um in general it just kind of didn't go anywhere you're like a I screwed up and then You' get teased a bit and then it would kind of dissipate"]

Answer: 

Less sleep, excessive blue light exposure, and inactivity can lead to a range of interconnected health issues:

1. Sleep Disruption: Exposure to bright light, especially blue light from screens, in the evening or at night can disrupt our natural sleep-wake cycle. This is because light exposure during these hours suppresses the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood and learning. It also increases sensitivity to light, making it harder to fall asleep and potentially leading to fragmented sleep patterns.

2. Metabolic Disturbances: Even a single night of sleeping in a moderately lit environment can cause metabolic issues. Studies have shown increases in nighttime heart rate, decreases in heart rate variability, and increases in next-morning insulin resistance. These changes indicate that the sympathetic nervous system is overly active and glucose management is impaired.

3. Mood and Mental Health Problems: The suppression of dopamine due to nighttime light exposure can lead to mood disturbances, increased anxiety, and even contribute to certain forms of depression. This is partly due to the activation of the habenula, sometimes called the "disappointment nucleus," which can make us feel less happy and more disappointed.

4. Cognitive Issues: The combination of poor sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms can result in learning problems, difficulty focusing, and overall cognitive decline.

5. Physical Health Concerns: Inactivity, often associated with increased screen time and less outdoor exposure, can contribute to various health problems. This includes an increased risk of myopia (nearsightedness) due to lack of exposure to natural light and distant vision.

6. Circadian Rhythm Disruption: The misalignment of light exposure, activity, and feeding rhythms can severely impact our circadian system. This disruption can affect nearly every aspect of our physiology, from hormone production to metabolism.

7. Mitochondrial Dysfunction: The combination of poor sleep, excessive artificial light exposure, and inactivity can synergistically impact our mitochondria, the powerhouses of our cells. This can lead to widespread cellular dysfunction and contribute to various health issues.

To mitigate these issues, it's crucial to prioritize proper sleep hygiene, limit blue light exposure in the evening, increase daytime exposure to natural light, and maintain regular physical activity.

every once in a while,\nit\'s not gonna be a problem to get bright light exposure to your eyes in the middle of the night, but if you think about\nour lifestyle nowadays and being up late looking at phones, even if you dim that screen, you\'re triggering this activation because your retinal sensitivity and the sensitivity of\nthese neurons has gone up late in the day.\n\nNow, I\'m not here to dictate what you should or shouldn\'t do, but for those of you that are experiencing challenges with mood, those of you that have anxiety, learning problems, issues focusing, the questions I usually get\nare, "How can I focus better?"\n\nWell, we will get to that, but one of the best ways you can support your mechanisms for good\nmood, mental health, learning, focus, metabolism, et cetera, is to take control of this\nlight exposure behavior at night and not get much or any\nbright light exposure in the middle of the night.', "What if you wake up in\nthe middle of the night and you find yourself watching\nTV or on the computer?\n\nWell, in that case, you might\nwanna wear blue blockers, and you certainly would\nwanna dim the screen, but ideally, you're not doing that, it's remarkable the positive effects of getting that bit of\nsunlight early in the day, maybe even also around sunset, and avoiding bright lights, and especially overhead bright lights, between about 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m..\n\nNow, I'm not talking about shift work, I'm realizing that we're probably gonna have to have an entire discussion devoted just to shift workers because there's some\ngood information there about how they can protect themselves against some of the very bad\nhealth effects of shift work, of getting light in the\nmiddle of the night, but we rely on shift workers and they're super important to culture and society and the economy, so I wanna acknowledge them and let you know that\nwe will do a discussion about shift work and jet lag, but let's talk about what light can do in terms of shifting us in healthy ways.", "So while we've mainly been talking about the positive effects of UVB light and other forms of light, now we have two examples.\n\nOne from the work of Hattar and colleagues showing that UVB exposure\nvia the perihabenula can diminish the output of dopamine and other molecules that make us feel good if that UVB exposure is\nin the middle of the night or late evening.\n\nAnd now we have yet\nanother study performed, in this case, in humans, indicating that even if we fall asleep and sleep the whole night through, if the room that we're\nsleeping in has too many lux, too much light energy, that light energy is no doubt\ngoing through the eyelids, which it can, activating\nthe particular cells in the eye that trigger an increase in sympathetic nervous system activation and disrupting our metabolism.\n\nAnd this study rests on a\nnumber of other recent studies published in Cell, which\nis a superb journal, and other journals, showing\nthat during the course of a healthy, deep night's sleep, our body actually transitions through various forms\nof metabolic function.\n\nWe actually experience\nketosis-like states.\n\nWe experience glucogenesis.\n\nWe experience different\nforms of metabolism associated with different stages of sleep, not something that we're\ngoing into in depth in this podcast, we will\nin a future podcast.", "During our discussion today,\nDr. Hattar answers questions that are absolutely\nessential for us to know about our health and wellbeing.\n\nFor instance, how to\nalign our sleep schedule with our activity\nschedule, such as exercise, and how to align light,\nactivity and exercise with our feeding rhythms.\n\nHe presents a new model\nof how light, activity, and feeding rhythms converge\nto support optimal health.\n\nAnd when those are not aligned correctly, how our mental and\nphysical health can suffer.\n\nIt's a discussion that is rich\nwith scientific mechanism, made clearly, of course, so\neverybody can understand, as well as specific\nprotocols to deal with shifts in day length, shifts in activity, and in order to optimize\nsleep, metabolism, and wellbeing of various kinds.", "They also looked at glucose responses.\n\nThey had people essentially\ntake a fasting glucose test in different conditions.\n\nI won't go into all the details, but here's what they found.\n\nIn healthy adults, even\njust one night of sleeping in a moderately lit environment, this hundred lux\nenvironment, caused changes, increases in nighttime heart rate, which means that the\nsympathetic nervous system was overly active as compared to people that slept in a completely dark or in a very, very dimly lit room.\n\nDecreases in heart rate variability, and here I should point out\nthat heart rate variability or HRV is a good thing, we\nwant heart rate variability.\n\nSo they saw increases in heart rate, decreases in heart rate variability, and increases in next\nmorning insulin resistance, which is an indication that\nglucose management is suffering.\n\nSo this is powerful.", 'So the simple way to think about this is you want as much light\nas is safely possible early in the day, morning\nand throughout the day, including blue light, so take those blue\nblockers off during the day unless you have a real issue\nwith screen light sensitivity, and you want as little\nlight coming into your eyes, artificial or sunlight, after, say, 8:00 p.m., and certainly, you do not want to get bright light exposure to your eyes between 11:00 p.m. and\n4:00 a.m., and here\'s why, David Berson, who I mentioned before, and another and friend and\ncolleague, Samer Hattar, who\'s director of the chronobiology unit at the National Institutes\nof Mental Health published a paper in\n"Cell," which is a journal, another excellent journal,\nvery high stringency, showing that light that\narrives to the eyes between 11:00 p.m. and\n4:00 a.m., approximately, suppresses the release of dopamine, this neuromodulator\nthat makes us feel good, and it\'s sort of an\nendogenous antidepressant, and can inhibit learning and create all sorts of\nother detrimental effects, it does this through a mechanism, for those of you that wanna\nknow the neural pathways, that involves light to the eyes that\'s then signaled to a\nstructure called the habenula, the habenula looks like\ntwo little bat ears sitting right in the middle\nof a structure in your brain called the thalamus, don\'t worry about these names if you\'re not interested in this stuff, if you are, these are\njust avenues to explore, when that habenula gets activated it\'s actually called the\ndisappointment nucleus because it actually\nmakes us feel less happy and more disappointed, and can lead to certain\nforms of depression in the wakeful state.', "Many people are experiencing\nsevere vision problems, because they're not getting\nenough sunlight during the day.\n\nThey have sleep problems, because they're not viewing\nsunlight early in the day.\n\nAnd as I've mentioned\nin previous episodes, they're getting a lot of\nartificial stimulation, artificial light stimulation, of the eye in the middle of the night, all of this is through the visual system.\n\nSo migraines, fatigue, challenges with your eyesight\ngetting worse as you age, or even in young people, there's a, you know, at least according to the articles, they describe it as\nthis epidemic of myopia can largely be dealt\nwith by getting outside, going into panoramic vision, experiencing some distanced vision, look at things off in the horizon.\n\nIf you're walking or hiking or biking, not looking at your phone the whole time that you're doing that.\n\nIf you're at the bus\nstop or you're commuting, certainly not looking at your phone the entire time you're doing that.\n\nSo this is vital.", "Why am I throwing out all this verbiage?\n\nWell, because people have\nasked for more mechanisms.\n\nSo, if you really want to know, when you look at blue light or if blue light is getting\nin through your eyelids in the middle of the night, it is likely distorting this lens accommodation\nmechanism in the eye and leading to myopia in some cases.\n\nSo, that's one reason to\navoid blue light exposure and bright light exposure,\neven nightlight exposure, in middle of the night.\n\nViewing any light of bright intensity between the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM on a consistent basis is\ngoing to suppress dopamine, because of the way that that light activates these melanopsin cells, and the habenula, and the dopamine system.\n\nSo it's all very simple, get as much bright light\nas you can safely, right?\n\nYou never want to look\nat any light so bright that it's painful look\nat, during the daytime.\n\nTry and go without sunglasses,\nunless you need them.\n\nNow, I wear sunglasses for sake of sport and sake when it's really bright out, but I try to get two hours a day of working outside or being outside, even if there's cloud cover,\nthat's going to offset myopia.\n\nIt's going to help you get better sleep.\n\nIt's going to support mood\nand metabolism, et cetera.", "Now let's talk about\nthe bad effects of light because light is not supposed\nto arrive in our system at any time, and nowadays, because of\nscreens and artificial light, we have access to light\nat times of day and night that normally we wouldn't.\n\nNow, earlier I said that\nyou need a lot of light, in particular, sunlight, to set these clock mechanisms, that's true, but there's a\nkind of diabolical feature to the way all of this works, which is the longer you've been awake, the more sensitive your retina\nand these cells are to light, so that if you've been\nawake for 10, 12, 14 hours, it becomes very easy for\neven a small amount of light coming from a screen or\nfrom an overhead light to trigger the activation of the clock and make you feel like\nyou wanna stay up later, make it harder to fall asleep, and disrupt your sleep pattern, okay?", "and So currently what's happening is that our environment the environment that our cells exist in across every single facet of our life over the past 50 to 75 years has changed rapidly you look at how our food system has changed from whole real food in good soil to Industrial food our sleep habits have changed we're sleeping less it's very fragmented our movement patterns have changed we're sitting 80% of the waking day our time in nature has changed we actually are indoors As Americans 93% of a 24-hour periods that totally changes our relationship with light we have 80,000 synthetic toxins in our food water air personal care products home care products we live a Thermon neutral existence now with our thermostats there's no real swings in temperature unless you're in intentionally trying to um and then our emotional health is very different we are very much exposed to lowgrade chronic stress triggers so across food sleep movement emotional health toxins light and temperature things are not what they once were and it's changed in the blink of an eye I mean the light bulb was created in 1806 this is like 0.04% of human history that we' even had artificial light so things have changed and the the unique thing about all of these Chang in our environment is that each one of those pillars each of those changes in our environment synergistically directly hurts the mitochondria through different mechanisms The Chronic low-grade stress the sitting the ultr processed nutrient devoid food even the the blue light at nighttime all of it through different core biologic mechanisms synergistically hits this part of the cell the mitochondria", "- So this is the way you\njustify staying out late every once in a while.\n\n- Well, in the meetings you've seen me in, I've done this for five\nor six days continuously, but what you didn't see that\nwhen I came back to my home, it took me two weeks\nas if I did a jet lag.\n\nSo I really do suffer for two weeks after doing a six crazy\nnight of staying up at night, drinking at the wrong time of the day.\n\nSo it's not that I'm\ncompletely okay with it.\n\nWhen I go back, everything goes back.\n\nIt takes me actually\nliterally two weeks to recover from the circadian rhythm meeting that you've seen me\npartying at some point.\n\n- Which is kind of ironic\nthat the circadian rhythm- - I know.\n\n- Meaning people are totally disrupting their circadian cycle, but scientists are human beings too.\n\n- Right, so I think if you do\nit at very little occasions, I think you should not worry too much that this will have lasting impact.\n\nAnd the good news is that if\nyou readjust your schedule, you could come back to it.\n\nThe problem is when you\nmaintain this wrong schedule for a prolonged time\nand it becomes chronic, prolonged periods of time, that's when you have the problems and the accumulation of the problems.\n\nSo when you have sleeping problem, you produce metabolic problem.\n\nWhen you have metabolic problems, you produce lack of exercise.\n\nAnd you could see how things\ncan spiral out very quickly.\n\nAnd then it would be\nhard to come back to it. -\n\nWell, certainly sleep disruption is both a symptom of and-\n- Yes. -\n\nA cause of almost all-\n- Absolutely. - Mental health disorders.\n\n- Absolutely. -\n\nAnd certainly the metabolic syndromes that people are talking about\nnowadays and all of this, it all funnels back to light.\n\nThis is what's so remarkable."]

Answer: 

Outdoor adventures in childhood have a significant positive impact on memories and independence, especially when compared to the increasing digital reliance we see today. 

Unstructured playtime outdoors provides children with crucial experiences that foster independence and create lasting memories. When children are allowed to explore their neighborhoods, ride bicycles, and engage in free play, they learn essential life skills. These include negotiating situations with peers, resolving conflicts, recognizing social cues, and collaborating with others. These experiences contribute to the development of self-supervision skills and the ability to navigate real-world situations independently.

Dr. Jonathan Haidt emphasizes the importance of "restoring a really fun adventurous childhood" where exciting and sometimes scary things happen, creating vivid memories that last a lifetime. He contrasts this with the virtual adventures children experience through video games, suggesting that these digital experiences are not as impactful or memorable.

The shift towards a more digitally reliant childhood, particularly since 2010-2012, has led to what Dr. Haidt calls a "phone-based childhood." Children now spend an average of 5-7 hours per day on social media alone, with total screen time often reaching 7-10 hours daily. This extensive digital engagement is described as "incompatible with healthy human development."

Digital reliance can limit the opportunities for real-world experiences and independence. The constant connection to devices can interfere with the development of crucial social skills and reduce the time spent in unstructured play. This shift has been so dramatic that some experts are calling for a return to more traditional, play-based childhoods with increased independence and real-world adventures.

It's worth noting that outdoor experiences, particularly in nature, have additional benefits. They can reduce anxiety, improve vision (reducing myopia), and help regulate circadian rhythms. These benefits further underscore the importance of outdoor adventures in childhood development.

In conclusion, outdoor adventures in childhood appear to have a strong positive impact on memory formation and the development of independence. In contrast, excessive digital reliance may hinder these aspects of child development by reducing opportunities for real-world experiences and unstructured play.

the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the

years I don't mean that it won't be seven-year-olds on phones but in the same way that we flipped on smoking we used to think it was okay to smoke in an airplane uh we used to think it was okay to smoke in restaurants it was okay to smoke everywhere we thought um and now we don't we don't think that anymore that took a long time to change but it did change I think because of the public disgust with seeing children just spending their childhood looking at a screen and because the public disgust with what we've heard about meta and and Tik Tok and a few of the other companies um I think within two years it's going to be widespread it'll be a norm that you just don't give kids social media in particular I mean iPads are complicated because you know you want kids you know to watch movies is okay stories are good I'm not saying the you know iPad is a terrible thing but um our attitudes about this are going to change radically um and I think the great majority of schools are going to be phone free within two years um and we're going to see we're already seeing more kids outside lot every day I get I get emails from Greatful parents saying you know because of your book me know my six-year-old he wanted to ride his bicycle down to the end of our cesac he wanted to ride down Circle and come back and I never would let him because I was afraid that what what would the neighbors say but once I read your book I decided to let him and he was so ecstatic he kept doing it and doing it and now he's going further and he rides to his friends houses so people in her neighborhood now they're seeing a kid on a bicycle and if Suppose there were 10 kids doing it well now it's normal so we can renormalize human childhood in the real world where our kids get the chance

that then sell back the illusion of some sense of agency little by little right a temporary agency and then puts you back into the cycle and there's something about going into nature which just um removes one from all of that at least temporarily gives you a more basic understanding of the relationship to self and things around us even just looking being able to see it to a distance we know is

practice of\nputting your feet on the Earth directly with bare\nfeet, oftentimes into soil or on a lawn.\n\nAnd it\'s a question that I\nseem to get more and more.\n\nIn fact, every week for quite a\nlong while now, on social media or elsewhere, somebody asks me\nabout the scientific support for this practice of grounding.\n\nSo obviously there\'s\na lot of interest in what the scientific research\nsays about getting into nature and putting one\'s\nfeet on the ground, a.k.a. grounding, and so on.', "but I worry that right now that we've almost somehow made that kind of unstructured time seem inefficient you know we've set these standards uh for our kids that they need to be uh you know getting fancy jobs and into fancy colleges and making an x amount of money and the path to doing that is you know to be enrolled in X number of activities after school and to do all this stuff in school and their lives are so hyper structured um that I worry that the time to just play to be creative to reflect and think to just have unstructured time with other kids has evaporated and I think that that also is hurting the mental health and wellbeing of our children I love the idea that that unstructured play time could be framed in the accurate context of the nervous system developing the way it was supposed to develop I mean I would argue that um success is going to be easiest for children that engage in the real world more in fact there's great risk to posting everything that you do online we've seen some examples of that preventing people from getting into or staying in college based on things they said or did previously that they shouldn't have said or done um that's those are kind of you know negative highlighted cases but in general um we know that the the nervous system thrives on diversity of types of interactions and social interactions in particular I'm just restating what you just said", '- It reminds me, as a neurobiologist, was weaned in the landscape\nof so-called critical periods, where early life environment\nvery strongly shapes the brain.\n\nAnd so many studies were\ndone on animals raised in traditional cages with a\nwater bottle and some food, maybe a few other animals\nof the same species.\n\nAnd then people came along and said, wait, normally these species in\nthe wild would have things like things to climb over\nand things to go through, and you provide those very basic elements, and all of a sudden the\narchitecture of neural circuits looks very different, and you realize that were studying a deprived condition.', "whatever but um but kids need to be out playing with each other especially Outdoors we evolved in savanas we evolved in different parts of the world we're attracted to Nature um so that's the way it it always was now uh especially if we in the 1950s and 60s America just been through a World War and the greatest way to make people trust each other the greatest way to boost social capital is a foreign attack and of course Pearl Harbor did more for American Co coherence than anything else in history in modern history 911 did that too but only for a little while and then we we lost it um so for a a lot of reasons people trusted their neighbors kids were out playing you know my parents grew up in the depression in New York City the kids were all out playing stickball on the street or in a parking lot in the 1970s there is a real crime wave um crime goes through the roof actually and it goes through the 80s that goes all the way to the early 90s even still you were kicked out of the house to go play um even in New York City all kids went out to play that's just the way it was but we begin to lose trust in each other for a lot of reasons Robert putam wrote about this in Bowling alone the the the the loss of Social Capital many reasons for that the changing media environment air conditioning and television people are not hanging out on their porch in the summertime to get away from the Heat they Clos the door and they put on the AC and they watch TV family sizes are shrinking there are not that many kids around so for a lot of reasons by the the 90s is the key decade where act two of the tragedy happens and that's the loss of the play-based childhood"]

Ground Truths: ["Outdoor adventures in childhood create lasting memories and foster independence, as they involve real-life experiences and challenges that children navigate themselves. In contrast, reliance on digital experiences, such as video games, does not provide the same depth of memory or personal growth, leading to concerns about the impact of technology on children's development and social skills."]

Answer: 

Youth's compulsive digital habits, particularly excessive smartphone and social media use, have significant negative effects on their emotional well-being. Research indicates that adolescents are spending an average of 3.5 hours per day on social media alone, with many using it for far longer periods. This excessive use is associated with a range of emotional and psychological issues.

One of the most concerning impacts is on mental health. Studies have shown that adolescents who use social media for 3 hours or more per day have double the risk of experiencing anxiety or depression symptoms. This increased risk is likely due to various factors, including disrupted sleep patterns, constant comparison with others, and exposure to potentially harmful content.

The compulsive nature of digital use among youth is evident in their behavior. Many adolescents report staying up until midnight or later on weeknights using their devices, primarily for social media. This habit significantly disrupts their sleep patterns, which is crucial for mental health and overall well-being, especially during the critical developmental stages of adolescence.

Self-esteem and body image are also negatively affected by compulsive digital habits. Nearly half of adolescents report that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image. This issue, once primarily affecting girls, is now increasingly observed in boys as well. The constant comparison to others online and exposure to unrealistic standards of appearance contribute to these negative self-perceptions.

The impact on social interactions is another area of concern. While digital platforms can provide opportunities for connection, they often lead to shallow relationships and decreased face-to-face interactions. Many young people report feeling lonely despite being constantly connected online. This paradox suggests that digital interactions may not fulfill the deep social needs that are crucial for emotional well-being.

Furthermore, the compulsive use of digital devices can be likened to a form of obsessive-compulsive behavior. Users often feel compelled to check their devices frequently, even when it interferes with other activities or thought processes. This constant distraction can lead to difficulties in concentration and may negatively impact academic performance.

It's important to note that while these digital habits have clear negative impacts, they are not uniformly harmful for all youth. Some young people, particularly those from marginalized communities, may find valuable support and self-expression opportunities through these platforms. However, the overall trend suggests that the current level of digital engagement among youth is generally detrimental to their emotional well-being.

In conclusion, the compulsive digital habits of youth, characterized by excessive smartphone and social media use, are significantly impacting their emotional well-being. From increased risks of anxiety and depression to negative effects on self-esteem, sleep, and social interactions, the evidence points to a concerning trend that requires attention from parents, educators, and policymakers.

Contexts: ["so there's a lot going on going on here um for some for some of them they are addicted and they feel bad for the reasons you were talking about dopamine overshoot or they feel bad when they're not doing the addictive activity so they are compulsively using it just like a a gambler if you're addicted to slot machines your life sucks you've spent all your family's money you're ashamed of what happened you feel terrible oh but if I just get back into the Zone on the slot machine I feel good for that two or three hours that's the most dangerous addiction cuz as it's been described to me I'm fortunately not a gambling addict addict excuse me the Gambler really does believe that the next one could change everything right it's going to it's going to cause motivated reasoning it's going to cause hopefulness that is dashed um so for some of them it is a kind of self-medication as soon as the boys move their social lives onto video games and porn and the girls move their social Liv on social media both sexes got really lonely um it's you know they're getting lots of cheap and easy stimulation but it's not satisfying so what do they do now that they're lonely and anxious", "but there's this concept of wordlessness of The Importance of Being in states of wordlessness where we're not reading we're not thinking in complete sentences we're not um taking in sensory information and we under those conditions are able to actually register how we feel about things like we become better tuned to um sense our environment and input when it comes and I wonder because my experience of social media has been whether or not kids are on Instagram Snapchat Etc and they're doing it out of whatever compulsion have addiction whatever you want to call it but I'm not sure it feels good to them I'm not sure it does I'm not sure it's like the ice cream that tastes delicious I think it might start that way and occasionally you know they're jackpots right but that in large part adults but since we're talking about kids let's talk about kids in this very critical sensitive period of Life are not feeling good and they might not even know they're not feeling good they're just compulsively there I'm using the term loosely not clinically compulsively engaging and so I wonder whether or not there's some benefit to kids not just being bored for experiencing boredom sake but learning to actually be a better sensor of what they like and don't like because when I talk to my niece or I talk to other young people now they they seem to be like becoming increasingly aware of how much some of the online stuff sucks that's the language they're not like oh it's awesome don't take it away from me they're like I don't want to miss out but it's also painful to them it's I mean it's like they're drinking from a fire hose of nails and then every once in a while there's something that tastes good it's it's not like they're like this is so cool and that's so cool but of course if you give them a really cool video of a animal thing or a social dynamics thing or a war game or whatever they'll get excited but I don't get the impression that they're like this is awesome it's more like this has me by the short hairs it's got me scruffed and I'm just doing it and I don't know how to stop that's that's and that's certainly the way sorry the certainly the way that boys reach out guys young guys typically reach out about their porn addictions I hear about this thousands of messages help me get over this so I refer them to our episode on addiction by Dr Anna lmy from Stanford yeah she's amazing that episode yeah she's she's spectacular or um it's just they're desperate they're desperate so I don't see it as all pleasure I see it as mostly pain that's right"]

Retrieved Contexts: ["oh if you're being contacted by strange men around the world who want to have sex with you like that's not good for 11 12 year old girls so it's all these different potential harms and then imagine all these different potential effects S one of which is depression and another is anxiety another is self harm but there's doing worse in school there's becoming more shallow there's uh conflicts with your so there's a whole bunch and then we want to look at the causal connections and what I'm trying to draw out is suppose you we suppose we could quantify the degree to which sheer time just spending five hours a day does that make you more anxious automatically well maybe a little um but that's probably not the main effect so there's a gigantic multicausal network of effects now um I have good numbers for how much the how much teenss are using these devices and these platforms today um Pew in particular did has done a great job of of tracking changes in this since the ear since the 2000s what we know today from both Pew and Gallup is that young people in America are now spending about five hours a day just on social media just social media", "so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", "so I I point to that it's that 5-year period 2010 to 2015 which I've called the Great rewiring of childhood because it affects everything everything about what children and teenagers are doing I can recall in 2010 I was actually in New York City visiting friends I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting yeah nowadays I think of it less as addicting but almost um like an an OCD of sorts and here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD but the interesting thing about OCD is that the compulsions the behaviors don't serve to reduce the obsessions rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them and in many ways I feel like smartphone use and social media use in particular is a OCD of sorts it's not just habit it's not just an addiction it's an obsessive compulsive Loop so it's already a struggle to pay attention and you know ancient Traditions have have taught techniques to improve your focus your attention we're easily distracted and um you know so I don't work on my phone very much because I I hate to type on the phone and and I'm always at a computer but even for me sitting at my computer as soon as the thinking gets hard as soon as if I'm writing if I'm doing something that requires concentration some little part of my brain says I wonder what the weather's going to be and I go check the weather or you know oh did I get any email I go check my I might check my email you know probably 40 50 times a day and I know that's terrible so the question is is it a compulsion where I feel pulled I have to check it or something bad will happen no it's more like imagine trying to do your work imagine trying to be a kid in school and you have on your desk in front of you you have your television set your record player a walkie talk to talk to your friends a guitar a painting set all array in front of you and your teacher is telling you about you know geometry what are you going to do probably one of these things and so I think the smartphone where a flip phone it's it's a tool you pull it out if you want to talk to someone then you put it away but the smartphone there's no reason to ever put it away talk to us about the scary statistics there's just no way around this yeah", "so you can have two parents who are married and living in the same home and may or may not be a good relationship but living in the same home if there's no conflict or that then generally teens will do well or as you're saying there's not necessarily a direct correlation the problem comes in whether parents are living at home together or separated or divorced is if there's conflict and then that conflict tends to result in social issues emotional issues a lot of social anxiety a lot of feeling like I need to do better so that way my parents like me more and we see that with children too that's not just adolescence a lot of depression and with depression can come self-medication and uh self-medicating around other drugs and so on but that generally is resolved if the conflict resolves but as you're saying we're seeing adolescent angst regardless of parenting uh what we really need though it's not a matter of just the divorce or not divorce or the relationship between the parents it's parenting that's important so parents being good monitors being involved in their kids' lives not this oh you're 16 you have a car you can go wherever you want and we're not going to keep an eye on you we still need parents to monitor to pay attention to find out their kids' friends where are they going after school that discretionary time when parents are working and teenagers come home between 3 and 5 or 3 and six tends to be the most risky couple of hours they're it's called discretionary hours where there's no parent around and we don't always know where those teenagers are hanging out so that's more important knowing where their children are and what they're doing and that there's some adult presence some monitoring then whether or not they're still in a relationship my sense is that smartphones have allowed more communication and monitoring between parents and kids but also more interactions between kids and other kids and kids and adults more broadly so is there any evidence that uh the Advent of smartphones is directly creating problems for kids that um has to do with just so much more PE PE to peer interaction or peer to-peer exposure like when I was growing up we didn't have smartphones uh if you did something stupid like that meaning that kids would laugh at it might get told to a small group of people maybe a larger group of people but um in general it just kind of didn't go anywhere you're like a I screwed up and then You' get teased a bit and then it would kind of dissipate", "so there's a lot going on going on here um for some for some of them they are addicted and they feel bad for the reasons you were talking about dopamine overshoot or they feel bad when they're not doing the addictive activity so they are compulsively using it just like a a gambler if you're addicted to slot machines your life sucks you've spent all your family's money you're ashamed of what happened you feel terrible oh but if I just get back into the Zone on the slot machine I feel good for that two or three hours that's the most dangerous addiction cuz as it's been described to me I'm fortunately not a gambling addict addict excuse me the Gambler really does believe that the next one could change everything right it's going to it's going to cause motivated reasoning it's going to cause hopefulness that is dashed um so for some of them it is a kind of self-medication as soon as the boys move their social lives onto video games and porn and the girls move their social Liv on social media both sexes got really lonely um it's you know they're getting lots of cheap and easy stimulation but it's not satisfying so what do they do now that they're lonely and anxious", "There are some studies\nand one in particular that I'd like to highlight one was actually carried\nout pretty early in 2014.\n\nThis is a study that\nexplored smartphone use at the time they called\nit mobile phone use, but smartphone use and inattention, difficulties in attending\nin 7,102 adolescents that's a huge study, a population based cross-sectional study and you will be probably\nsurprised and somewhat dismayed to hear that in order\nto avoid this decrease in attentional capacity, adolescents needed to use their smartphone for less than 60 minutes per day, in order to stay focused and\ncentered on their other tasks.\n\nOtherwise they started to really run into significant issues.\n\nSo 60 minutes is not much, I've a feeling that most young people are using their phone more\nthan 60 minutes per day, I know I am.\n\nI think for adults, the number's probably higher\nmeaning if you're an adult, I'm going to just extrapolate\nfrom what I read in this study.\n\nIt seems that probably two\nhours a day on the phone would be the upper limit beyond which you would probably experience pretty severe attentional deficits.", "I mean, you give a young child,\neven an infant, an iPad, I mean, that kid is in the tunnel.\n\nI don't necessarily\nthink that's a bad thing.\n\nAnd computers and computer screens\nare going to be a part of their lives now and forever, presumably.\n\nBut it is the case that there are a lot\nof people who perhaps have the propensity for a strong generative drive, but\nbecause they also have a propensity for a pleasure drive, they wake up, they pick\nup the phone, they look at the phone, something captivates their attention,\nthen they're thinking about that.\n\nIt might be something that brings\nthem delight, but more often than not, it's something that brings\nthem either mild irritation or mild entertainment, maybe even intense\nentertainment for a short while.\n\nBut very quickly, minutes and hours go by\nin which we are not engaging in the world unless we are posting valuable content.\n\nAnd so social media is a bit\nof a drain on these drives.\n\nI mean, it taps into these\ndrives in very strong ways.\n\nAnd all one has to do is observe\nthe behavior of people in public spaces, now, in airports, on\ntrains, even in their cars.\n\nAnd people are essentially\nwatching TV all day long.", "so yes there is some evidence that overall phones and smartphones have increased risk behavior but it's more the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "but there's clear evidence about viewing pornography around just not having goodal healthy sexual relationships because porn is not normal it is it is not a normal relationship between two people what you are doing is really making it so that way you um you're you're not necessarily developing a healthy relationship with your partner because you're assuming some gold standard out there that may or may not be able to be achieved so um and it also is also a problem with body shaming and the body types that most people don't have and can't achieve and that's that that's another problem out there with with uh with with pornography a lot of questions about how social media impacts brain development that's probably an entire episode unto itself it is it is that that we could do another time and we should and um if you'd be so gracious to come back and do that we we will um I think as a just a final question you know is there any um information about potential causality between the Mental Health crisis that we observe in Youth and um let's just say substance use um of the sorts that we talked about today obviously the directionality is tricky there you can imagine that a lot of HGC cannabis use is leading to more psychosis but seems more likely that um kids are self-medicating correct in the face of like immense challenge you know not just the lockdowns and the culture around isolating kids from other kids and um the stress that was on everybody um stress generally the sociopolitical landscape social media I mean it's hard to not feel like it's at least a cloudier maybe a darker time than it used to be but I don't know I mean we humans have evolved through a lot um and it I don't know that it's also fair to say that everyone's you know bummed out about what they see presumably there's still some optimists out there so absolutely uh there there plenty of studies that show the bidirectional relationship between anxiety depression Mental Health and substance use you're right a lot of teens are self-medicating by using various substances to reduce their anxiety reduce their stress and also just social lubrication right of going into a party and and pregaming or going into a party and using drugs to make themselves uh less stiff less less stressed during that situation but more what we're talking about is that they're self-medicating because they're feeling sad or uncomfortable and this is they think helping them again it's not helping it's making them feel less bad had by continuing to use", "Now, the smartphone is\na very interesting tool for dopamine in light of all this.\n\nIt's extremely common\nnowadays to see people texting and doing selfies and\ncommunicating in various ways, listening to podcasts, listening to music, doing all sorts of\nthings while they engage in other activities or going to dinner and texting other people or making plans, sharing information.\n\nThat's all wonderful, it gives depth and\nrichness and color to life, but it isn't just about\nour distracted nature when we're engaging with the phone, it's also a way of layering in dopamine.\n\nAnd it's no surprise\nthat levels of depression and lack of motivation are\nreally on the increase.\n\nEverything that we've\ntalked about until now sets up an explanation or interpretation of why interacting with digital technology can potentially lead to disruptions or lowering in baseline\nlevels of dopamine.", "but you're trying to understand their experience is important also so you can help them understand what is not acceptable for them to experience on social media if they're being harassed or bullied by strangers uh that is a problem you want your child to to tell you about that to report that um if they see something posted online that's really concerning to them let's say they see a friend post that they're thinking of taking their own life or harming themsel in another way you want them to know that that's important to flag and to get help you know that they shouldn't just you know scroll past that so that conversation is really important and finally as parents we can lead by example right and this is hard because the truth is we've been talking about social media and youth and that's what the subject of my search and General's advisory was on but I have concerns about adults too I said as somebody who's had challenges in my own use you know of social media finding sometimes it bleeds you know past my bedtime and I'm realized you know I think m&a checked something for 5 minutes an hour later I'm still there you know scrolling through something uh and sometimes I you know you know I find myself over the years I found myself comparing myself also to posts I see online and unhealthy ways sometimes I find myself um sort of pulled into uh content uh that uh you know ends up being angry and vitriolic and leaves me feeling worse you know at the end", "and I'm not calling them adaptive or maladaptive they're clearly here to stay they've assisted in medicine I'm sure it makes it easier for doctors to communicate on the on the ward and and for um clinic and it's so useful right but contained in the small device um there are things like uh for instance text messaging where unlike 20 years ago we can have four or five different conversations very quickly while boarding a flight um there's a task switching element that was just not present in our life um prior to that um social media in particular this notion of being able to scroll so move if we really step back from this move one's thumb and access hundreds if not thousands of video content from dist which Each of which has a distinct context um and so I have to imagine that kids and adults have frontal coures that are learning these rules and the rule rule is move your thumbs stay engaged emotions either positive veence emotions or negative emotions I mean it's it's a fairly limited um landscape there when you really think about it"]

Ground Truths: ["Youth's compulsive digital habits often lead to feelings of loneliness and anxiety, as they engage in activities like video games and social media out of compulsion rather than genuine enjoyment. This compulsive engagement can result in a lack of awareness about their emotional state, as they may not realize they are not feeling good. Instead of providing satisfaction, these habits can create a sense of pain and desperation, particularly in the context of addiction to online content."]

Answer: 

Neural circuits play a significant role in the behaviors and interactions related to anxiety and depression in boys, though the information provided is not exclusively focused on boys. In general, these circuits involve connections between several key brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, dopamine centers, and the amygdala.

During puberty and adolescence, there's increased connectivity between these areas, which are involved in motivation, decision-making, reward processing, and emotional regulation. This heightened integration allows for testing of circuits related to emotions and rewards as they pertain to decision-making. As a result, adolescents, including boys, may engage in more risk-taking behaviors and experience intense emotional states.

For boys specifically, the neural circuits related to sex and violence are particularly heightened. These circuits have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years and can contribute to extreme behaviors and interactions. This heightened activity in these circuits may play a role in how boys experience and express anxiety and depression.

In the context of mental health issues like anxiety and depression, the fear-related neurons in these circuits can trigger autonomic arousal and stress responses. When activated, these neurons can cause physical symptoms such as pupil dilation, increased heart rate, and the release of stress hormones into the bloodstream. These physiological responses can contribute to the experience of anxiety in boys.

It's important to note that while these neural circuits are present in both boys and girls, their expression and impact may differ. Boys tend to have higher suicide rates and often use more violent means when attempting suicide, which may be related to the heightened activity in circuits associated with aggression and impulsivity.

However, the information provided doesn't offer a complete picture of how these neural circuits specifically affect anxiety and depression in boys as opposed to girls. More research focused on gender differences in these neural circuits and their relationship to anxiety and depression would be needed to provide a more comprehensive answer.

lot of changes and\nthickness of the brain at different stages, et cetera.\n\nBut I think most people will be interested in what that translates\nto in the real world.\n\nAnd what's interesting is during puberty, there's increased connection, connectivity as we call it\nbetween the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in\nmotivation and decision-making, being able to suppress action for making long-term goals possible, as well as dopamine\ncenters and the amygdala.\n\nSo there's this really broad\nintegration and testing.\n\nI think this is the key element here, testing of circuits\nfor emotions and reward as they relate to decisions.\n\nAnd I think that's useful because when you look at the behavior\nof adolescents and teens, they are testing social interactions, they are testing physical\ninteractions with the world.\n\nOftentimes they're engaging\nin unsafe behavior.\n\nI would never try and justify that with the underlying neurology, but the neuroscience points\nto increased connectivity between areas of the brain that\nare related to emotionality and to threat detection like\nthe amygdala, but also reward.\n\nSo it's a time of testing behaviorally how different behaviors\nlead to success or not.\n\nIt's how different behaviors\nlead to fear states or not.", "- Right, that is a central question.\n\nI can say, at least with\nrespect to the fear neurons that sit on top of the aggression neurons, we know that when those neurons are activated optogenetically, in the same way we would\nactivate the aggression neurons, that there's clearly an arousal\nprocess that's occurring, you can see the pupils\ndilate in the animal.\n\nThere is an increase in stress hormone release\ninto the bloodstream, we've shown that heart rate goes up.\n\nSo in addition to the\ndrive to actually freeze, which is what those animals do, there is autonomic arousal and neuroendocrine activation\nof stress responses.\n\nAnd some of that is probably shared by the aggression neurons\nand the mating neurons, although we haven't investigated\nit in as much detail, but I wouldn't be surprised because they project to\nmany of the same regions that the fear neurons project to, which is a interesting issue in the context to discuss later maybe, in the context of why we're comfortable with mental illnesses that are based on maladaptations of fear,\nbut not mental illnesses

more boys die from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or

depressive states, but mainly the manic\nstates of bipolar disorder.\n\nWe already discussed the\nfact that interception, registering of one's own internal emotions and bodily states is diminished in people with bipolar disorder.\n\nBut we haven't really talked\nabout the neural circuits that are responsible for\nthat lack of recognition.\n\nFor that reason, I'd like\nto point out a paper.\n\nThis is a fairly recent paper,\njust came out this year, but it's an excellent one, Looking at the changes over\ntime in neural circuitry in people with high genetic\nrisk for bipolar disorder, and in particular in young people.\n\nAnd studies of this sort are rare, but are exceedingly\nimportant because of the fact that they track individuals over time.\n\nThe title of this paper is, Longitudinal Changes in\nStructural Connectivity in Young People at High Genetic\nRisk for Bipolar Disorder.\n\nWe will provide a link to this study in the show note captions.", "These circuits that we're\ncalling pro-social circuits light up in the brain in neuroimaging, meaning the neurons are\nfiring more actively, more electrically robustly; sort of like turning up the volume on these neural circuits in the

quaking of the voice, all of the things are associated\nwith defensive behaviors are actually antagonized,\nmeaning they are reduced when the pro-social\ncircuits are more active.\n\nSo the framework here that I'd like to set is that we have this kind of seesaw of neural circuits in the brain.\n\nOne set that are\npro-social and are designed to bring us closer to\nothers, including ourselves, closer to certain sensory\nexperiences, right?\n\nBecause a lot of pro-social behaviors can also be geared towards\nthings like pets or food, or anything that we find\nwe want to be closer to and want

longer satisfying.\n\nHaving sex is no longer that much fun,\nwhich is a component of depression.\n\nIf there's a mechanism in the brain\nthat tells you something is rewarding, by definition, that's not functioning\nnormally in severe depression.\n\nSo we were doing models of\ndepression to figure out how the dopamine reward circuitry was\nchanging, as were many other labs.\n\nWe were studying addiction.\n\nThose were the obvious ones.\n\nAnd, I mean, it might be entertaining\nto your audience to learn how academic scientists think.\n\nI was thinking, those\nare fascinating topics.\n\nThey're pretty competitive.\n\nLots of other labs were working on it.\n\nAnd I started thinking what\nother experiences might be modifying the reward circuitry.\n\nI actually made some

not the premier, then certainly among the\ntop three premier journals in the field of science about the biology of\nadolescence and puberty, as well as some of the\ncore needs and demands that have to be met for successful emotional\nmaturation during that time.\n\nWe will provide a link to that, but I just want to highlight a few of the things that they\nplace in the final table.\n\nI don't want to go through\nall the results right now, because you could do that\non your own if you like.\n\nThey mainly highlight a lot of the changes in\nneurons and neural circuits.\n\nFor instance, I'll just highlight one, there's a connection between the dopamine centers in the brain and an area of the brain that's involved in emotion and dispersal.\n\nDispersal is very interesting.", "Now, that's a very broad statement, but we know for instance, in epilepsy, that GABA levels are reduced and therefore you get runaway excitation of certain circuits in the brain, and therefore seizures, either petite mal, mini seizures, or grand\nmal, massive seizures, or even drop seizures where\npeople completely collapse to the floor in seizure.\n\nYou may have seen this before.\n\nI certainly have, it's very dramatic and it actually is quite\ndebilitating for people because obviously they don't\nknow when these seizures are coming on most often, and then they can fall into a stove\nor while driving, et cetera.\n\nSo the situation with OCD is one in which, for whatever reason, we don't\nknow the direction of effect.\n\nCertain hormones are elevated in females and certain hormones are elevated in males and those hormones differ\nbetween males and females, and yet they both funnel into a system where GABAergic or GABA\ntransmission in the brain is reduced because of this ability for those particular hormones to be antagonists to GABA, and as a consequence, there's\nlikely to be overall levels of increased excitation in\ncertain networks in the brain and that brings us back to this cortico-striatal-thalamic loop, this repetitive loop\nthat seems to reinforce, we can say reinforces\nobsession, leads to anxiety, leads to compulsion, leads to\ntransient relief of anxiety, but then increase in anxiety,\nincreased obsession, anxiety, compulsion, anxiety,\ncompulsion, anxiety, compulsion, and so on and so forth."]

Ground Truths: ['The context discusses neural circuits related to sex and violence, which have evolved over a long period and are heightened in boys. However, it suggests that the underlying issues related to anxiety and depression are not being addressed, as the behaviors and interactions are happening faster and with more severe consequences. This implies that while neural circuits may influence behaviors, the deeper issues related to anxiety and depression are not being effectively managed or understood.']

Answer: 

Independence and free play are crucial for children's development, serving multiple important functions that shape their cognitive, social, and emotional growth.

Unstructured playtime is essential for children to learn vital life skills. During free play, children have the opportunity to negotiate situations with peers, resolve conflicts, and recognize social cues. These experiences help them develop crucial abilities like collaboration and emotional intelligence, which are fundamental for their future interactions and relationships.

Play also allows children to explore different roles and contingencies in a low-stakes environment. This exploration is critical for understanding social hierarchies, leadership, and group dynamics. Through role-play and other forms of imaginative play, children can safely experiment with various social positions and behaviors, helping them develop a sense of self and their place in the world.

The independence afforded by free play is particularly significant for brain development. As children engage in self-directed play, they strengthen neural connections related to decision-making, problem-solving, and creativity. This process of neural pruning and strengthening during play is fundamental in shaping who they become as adults, influencing their behaviors, emotions, and thought patterns.

Moreover, independent play fosters a sense of autonomy and self-reliance in children. When given the freedom to explore and make choices during play, children learn to trust their instincts, develop confidence in their abilities, and become more comfortable with independence. This self-directed learning is invaluable for their overall development and future success.

It's worth noting that the current trend of reduced unstructured playtime for children, partly due to increased screen time and more structured activities, may be impacting their mental health and development. Encouraging more opportunities for independent, free play could be beneficial in counteracting these effects and promoting healthier child development.

they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike

to have\nthings delivered to us, to the point where we are toddlers and we can access things in the world, but we tend to assume\nthat they are all ours.\n\nAnd then the next stage is the really key stage\nas it relates to play because is in the next\nstage of development is where young children start to interact with other children and there\'s an exchange and a possession and then a letting go of certain things, learning that not everything is yours and that the entire world is not about you is one of the key contingencies that is established during play.\n\nIt\'s one of the key way\nin which children go from being very self-centered and basically unable to\nengage with other kids for very long, without some sort of eruption of crying and some sort of battle of, you know, kind of push pull over an object to things like sharing and\nthings like cooperative play.', "So we establish that play is homeostatic, meaning we all need to do it.\n\nMany of us, including myself, haven't played that much as adults.\n\nWe're all pretty busy.\n\nNumber of us are stressed.\n\nWe got a lot to do in life, but as children, most all of us engage in a lot of play.\n\nAnd in looking at the way\nthat very young children and especially toddlers play, we can learn a lot because it reveals the fundamental rules by which the toddler brain\ninteracts with the world.", "So we can look at this\nstage of development, we call childhood and we can look at each stage\nof it and we can say, wow, there are all these\ndifferent dimensions of play that really are about testing out how we feel comfortable or uncomfortable, how we react good or bad, how we react with stress or with glee when others behave in certain ways.\n\nAnd so what I'm hoping is coming through is that play is not just about having fun.\n\nPlay is about testing.\n\nIt's about experimenting and it's about expanding\nyour brain's capacity.\n\nAnd that's through early in development, and it's through throughout the lifespan.\n\nSo at this point in the discussion, I want to take a step back, look at the biology and\nneurochemistry of play just a little bit.\n\nAnd that really define\nwhat is effective play.\n\nIf the goal of play is to\nexplore different contingencies in low stakes environments and to expand the function\nof our prefrontal cortex so that we can see new possibilities and new ways of being become\nmore flexible, more creative, more effective outside\nof the games of play or the arenas of play, I should say.", 'So as we transition from forms of play that are all about the self that are all me, me, me, me, "The Toddlers Creed" to forms of play that involve some discomfort in assuming roles that maybe we don\'t want and\nnot getting what we want.\n\nIt\'s really an opportunity for the brain to start to explore different\nroles that people take, how they work as individuals and as pairs and in larger groups.\n\nAnd to do that in a low\nstakes environment, right?\n\nYou wouldn\'t want this to be worked out on the battlefield or\nwhen searching for food or in some high stakes environment where the survival of the\nspecies was important.\n\nIt appears that these\ncircuitry for

can be explored in\na low stakes environment.', "Indeed that's what happens when children play when adolescents play and when young adults play, whether or not it's social play or play with an object, whether or not it's a\nsport or a play of any kind imaginary play imaginary friend play, there is a strengthening of\ncertain neural connections and a pruning away of up to 40%, perhaps even more of connections that are not necessary for\ncertain types of behaviors, emotions, and thoughts.\n\nAnd what this means is that it is through the process of play, that we become who we are as adults.\n\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, it is through the process of play that we are able to adjust\nwho we are as adults.\n\nNow, there are bounds on this process, as far as I know there's\nnever been a reported case of an individual who had a hyperplastic or I should say a brain that\nwas as plastic in adulthood as it was in childhood.\n\nBut what this tells us is that what we do in the process\nof play as children is really how we set up the rules for how we behave as adults\nin almost all domains, which is really incredible.", "The number of questions\ngoes on and on and on.\n\nAnd I will provide a link to a paper that asks a number of questions that helps you arrive at\na sort of score of sorts or an index of what Güneş\nand others have referred to as personal play identity.\n\nThe point is that if we look back to our early adolescence, somewhere between 10 and 14 years old, a peak time for social development, a peak time for play of various kinds, a peak time for motor development, a peak time of psychosocial development, where we learn where we\nfit into hierarchies.\n\nAs we relate to members of the same sex of the opposite sex, et cetera, we can start to get a portal into how and why we show up to\nvarious activities in work and relationship, et cetera, as adults.\n\nIn fact, I'll venture to say that\nif we go into that process for ourselves for five or 10 minutes, you start to see some remarkable parallels between the way you were at that stage and your tendencies and\nyour preferences as adults.", "One of my favorite things\nabout developmental biology and developmental psychology is that it is grounded in the fact that we don't just have a\nchildhood and an adulthood.\n\nThere isn't just our child\nself and our adult self.\n\nAnd even though there\nare transitions around the mechanisms that\nunderline neuroplasticity at approximately age 25, it is simply the case that development is our entire lifespan, that our lifespan is one\nlong developmental arc.\n\nHow long depends on our\ngenetics, our lifestyle accidents, injury and disease of course, but it is one long developmental arc.\n\nAnd so it shouldn't surprise us at all that how we learn to play as\na 10 year old or 12 year old would impact how we play\nand interact with people as a teenager and a young adult and on and on and on.\n\nAnd that play is the\nplace in which we explore in which we learn play is the substrate by which our nervous system changes us from this hyper-connected\nbatch of neurons, where everything is\nconnected to everything, more or less to a brain and nervous system whereby certain circuits work\nwith immense proficiency and others are less accessible to us.", 'Now you can look at your adult, counterparts, and indeed we should probably\nlook at ourselves and ask, you know did we learn\nproper play contingency when we were younger?\n\nDo we tend to take things too seriously?\n\nDo we tend to overreact aggressively when other people are clearly engaging in, you know, playful, jabbing or sarcasm or things of that sort.\n\nSo each of you will have a\ndifferent experience of this, but the point is that play\nserves many functions, it\'s not just about the self.\n\nIt\'s also about interactions\nbetween multiple people.\n\nIt\'s about rule testing and low stakes contingency rule breaking also\nserves an important role as is with the example\nof the "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting other puppies et cetera.\n\nAnd last but not least, there are different forms of play that help us establish who\nwe will become as adults.\n\nOne of the more powerful of these is role play when children\nand sometimes adults will take on different\nroles that are distinct from their natural world roles in order to for instance,\nestablish hierarchies.\n\nSo someone\'s going to be the leader and someone\'s going to be the follower.\n\nSomeone will be dominant.\n\nSomeone will be submissive.\n\nSomeone will work alone.\n\nOther people will work in a group.']

Ground Truths: ["Independence and free play are significant in children's development as they help restore a fun and adventurous childhood, allowing children to create memories through real-world experiences. These experiences foster independence and adventure, enabling children to work out conflicts themselves rather than relying on virtual adventures."]

Answer: 

The potential risks associated with social media exposure for young people are numerous and concerning. These risks can be broadly categorized into mental health, physical health, and social development issues.

Mental health risks are particularly prominent. Nearly half of adolescents report that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image, as they constantly compare themselves to others online. This issue affects both girls and boys. Moreover, adolescents who use social media for 3 hours or more per day double their risk of experiencing anxiety or depression symptoms. Given that the average use is 3.5 hours per day, this puts a majority of young people at risk.

Physical health is also impacted. About a third of adolescents report staying up until midnight or later on weeknights using their devices, with much of this time spent on social media. This reduction in sleep can significantly affect their overall well-being and development.

Social development risks include exposure to harmful content, harassment, and bullying. Alarmingly, six out of ten adolescent girls report being approached by strangers on social media in ways that made them feel uncomfortable. There's also concern about how social media use may be replacing in-person interactions and physical activities, potentially affecting social skill development.

The erosion of self-esteem is another significant risk. Social media can create pressure for young people to present a curated, inauthentic version of themselves online, rather than feeling confident in their true selves.

Time spent on social media is substantial, with young people in America spending about five hours a day just on these platforms. This extensive use can detract from other important activities and experiences crucial for healthy development.

It's important to note that while there are some benefits to social media use, such as self-expression and finding support from like-minded individuals, these benefits don't necessarily outweigh the potential harms.

While this information provides a comprehensive overview of the risks, it's worth noting that more research may be needed to fully understand the long-term impacts of social media use on young people's social and physical development.

you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", "oh if you're being contacted by strange men around the world who want to have sex with you like that's not good for 11 12 year old girls so it's all these different potential harms and then imagine all these different potential effects S one of which is depression and another is anxiety another is self harm but there's doing worse in school there's becoming more shallow there's uh conflicts with your so there's a whole bunch and then we want to look at the causal connections and what I'm trying to draw out is suppose you we suppose we could quantify the degree to which sheer time just spending five hours a day does that make you more anxious automatically well maybe a little um but that's probably not the main effect so there's a gigantic multicausal network of effects now um I have good numbers for how much the how much teenss are using these devices and these platforms today um Pew in particular did has done a great job of of tracking changes in this since the ear since the 2000s what we know today from both Pew and Gallup is that young people in America are now spending about five hours a day just on social media just social media", "so yes there is some evidence that overall phones and smartphones have increased risk behavior but it's more the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "but you're trying to understand their experience is important also so you can help them understand what is not acceptable for them to experience on social media if they're being harassed or bullied by strangers uh that is a problem you want your child to to tell you about that to report that um if they see something posted online that's really concerning to them let's say they see a friend post that they're thinking of taking their own life or harming themsel in another way you want them to know that that's important to flag and to get help you know that they shouldn't just you know scroll past that so that conversation is really important and finally as parents we can lead by example right and this is hard because the truth is we've been talking about social media and youth and that's what the subject of my search and General's advisory was on but I have concerns about adults too I said as somebody who's had challenges in my own use you know of social media finding sometimes it bleeds you know past my bedtime and I'm realized you know I think m&a checked something for 5 minutes an hour later I'm still there you know scrolling through something uh and sometimes I you know you know I find myself over the years I found myself comparing myself also to posts I see online and unhealthy ways sometimes I find myself um sort of pulled into uh content uh that uh you know ends up being angry and vitriolic and leaves me feeling worse you know at the end", "There are ways that\nit can be negative, in terms of bad interactions,\nthings like bullying, which we can talk about because\nthere's a lot that we've done to basically make sure that\npeople can be safe from that and give people tools and\ngive kids the ability to have the right parental controls.\n\nTheir parents can oversee that.\n\nBut that's the interacting\nwith people side.", "as our brain and bodies mature we have more autonomy in where we take them but that means also more exposure to the ideas suggestions actions pure pressure of others and um that's sometimes where the the problems arise and who knows probably also where the solutions come from too from time to time but I think as conscientious people um who mind the well-being of others of our species we'd all like to know sort of like what are the key features that Mark this stage of development maybe we'll just start off by talking about this through the lens of um your expertise as a developmental psychologist you know what is adolescence in the teen years like what's going on um what sorts of things are being worked out psychologically um that we might not be aware of and then we can talk about some of the common pitfalls and the risk-taking Behavior everything from smoking vaping drug use um sexual behavior uh addictive behaviors as it relates to social media bullying risky driving there's so much there", "People who treat teens often talk about\nthis, that you see something that you didn't often see before, where a person\nwho might have gotten through a lot of formative years thinking like, oh,\nhow I look is okay, for example, then is bombarding themselves with social\nmedia that tells them how they look is not okay, and then that changes."]

Ground Truths: ['The potential risks associated with social media exposure for young people include exposure to harmful content such as child predators and pornography. Additionally, excessive screen time can lead to physical issues like nearsightedness (myopia), as indicated by the observation that spending two hours outside can help offset this condition.']

Answer: 

Gambling addiction can have severe psychological effects on individuals, as discussed in several Huberman Lab podcast episodes. One of the most significant impacts is the persistent belief that the next gamble could change everything. This creates a cycle of hope and disappointment that can be particularly damaging to the addict's mental state.

The addiction often leads to a progressive narrowing of the things that bring pleasure in life. Gambling addicts may lose interest in other activities, relationships, and personal well-being as they become increasingly focused on gambling. This narrowing of interests can result in social isolation and a deterioration of overall life satisfaction.

The compulsive nature of gambling addiction can cause individuals to feel bad when they're not engaging in the activity. This discomfort drives them to seek out gambling opportunities, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of addiction. The temporary relief or excitement gained from gambling provides a form of self-medication for underlying feelings of loneliness or anxiety.

Gambling addiction can also lead to severe financial consequences, which in turn cause psychological distress. Addicts may experience shame, guilt, and anxiety related to spending family money or accumulating debt. These negative emotions can further fuel the addiction as the individual seeks escape through more gambling.

In some cases, gambling addiction can escalate to the point where it causes depression. As the addiction progresses, even gambling itself may cease to provide the same level of dopamine release or satisfaction, leaving the individual in a state of emotional emptiness.

It's important to note that breaking a gambling addiction can be particularly challenging. Unlike substance addictions where complete abstinence is possible, gambling addicts must learn to manage their behavior while still engaging with money in their daily lives, which can be likened to asking an alcoholic to drink moderately.

The psychological effects of gambling addiction are complex and can have far-reaching impacts on an individual's mental health, relationships, and overall quality of life.

and then work our way towards more typical circumstances and with that said addiction unfortunately is very common nowadays I just heard a statistic in fact that there is an 8080 percent increase in alcohol use disorder among women in the last 30 years I talked a little bit about this in the episode that I did about alcohol and health again I want to be very clear I'm not somebody that is completely against alcohol for adults provided they're not alcoholics turns out two drinks a week probably fine health-wise zero would be better if we're honest zero is better than any alcohol but two drinks a week is probably fine past two drinks you start running into problems and yet many many people out there male and female alike suffer from alcohol use disorder also called alcoholism the same is also true for things like methamphetamine or cocaine or other types of substance addictions and the same is also true for a lot of Behavioral or what are sometimes called process addictions things like sex addiction or video game addiction or any type of behavior that frankly is leveraging the dopamine system but that engages this Progressive narrowing of the things that bring someone pleasure such that nothing else is really Salient nothing else is really pulling them in in the way that they're video games or sex or pornography or alcohol pick your substance or you know behavior that you

Answer: 

Involving Child Protective Services (CPS) when a child is seen playing outside alone can have several serious consequences:

1. Legal implications: In some states, allowing a child to play outside unsupervised can be interpreted as evidence of child neglect. This ambiguity in laws has led to situations where parents face legal scrutiny for what was once considered normal childhood behavior.

2. Family disruption: Once CPS becomes involved, families can face significant disruptions. This may include custody battles and increased supervision, potentially limiting parents' ability to be alone with their children.

3. Overreaction to normal activities: The context mentions incidents where police were called because an 8-year-old was seen unaccompanied, highlighting how society's perception of childhood independence has changed dramatically since the 1990s.

4. Incentivizing overprotective parenting: The threat of CPS involvement can lead parents to become overly cautious, potentially limiting their children's independence and opportunities for unstructured play.

5. Long-term impact on child development: By discouraging independent outdoor play, children may miss out on important developmental experiences that contribute to their overall well-being and growth.

It's worth noting that efforts are being made to address these issues. For example, eight states have passed laws stating that allowing a child to play independently cannot be taken as evidence of child neglect. These legislative changes aim to restore a more balanced approach to childhood independence and reduce unnecessary CPS interventions.

However, it's important to recognize that the fear of child abduction, while statistically rare, has contributed to the current climate of heightened concern. According to FBI statistics mentioned in the context, there are only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings per year in the entire country, most often involving family members in custody disputes.

The unintended consequence of overprotection has been a significant increase in mental health issues among children, including a spike in suicide rates. This suggests that the societal response to perceived dangers may be causing more harm than the rare occurrences it aims to prevent.

the exas generation the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "whatever but um but kids need to be out playing with each other especially Outdoors we evolved in savanas we evolved in different parts of the world we're attracted to Nature um so that's the way it it always was now uh especially if we in the 1950s and 60s America just been through a World War and the greatest way to make people trust each other the greatest way to boost social capital is a foreign attack and of course Pearl Harbor did more for American Co coherence than anything else in history in modern history 911 did that too but only for a little while and then we we lost it um so for a a lot of reasons people trusted their neighbors kids were out playing you know my parents grew up in the depression in New York City the kids were all out playing stickball on the street or in a parking lot in the 1970s there is a real crime wave um crime goes through the roof actually and it goes through the 80s that goes all the way to the early 90s even still you were kicked out of the house to go play um even in New York City all kids went out to play that's just the way it was but we begin to lose trust in each other for a lot of reasons Robert putam wrote about this in Bowling alone the the the the loss of Social Capital many reasons for that the changing media environment air conditioning and television people are not hanging out on their porch in the summertime to get away from the Heat they Clos the door and they put on the AC and they watch TV family sizes are shrinking there are not that many kids around so for a lot of reasons by the the 90s is the key decade where act two of the tragedy happens and that's the loss of the play-based childhood", "most Instagram no so it the the huge time suck is the videos so it's actually Tik Tok and YouTube are counted in this analysis they're counted as social media YouTube is marginally social media it's more of an general information Source but the point is especially the short videos the short videos are really really addictive because the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the house every day to go play my mom would say get out of the house I now realize she wanted space yeah", "so in America and Britain we freaked out about child abduction and child sexual abuse um some of the scandals were real the Boy Scouts the Catholic Church there were cases where trusted organizations were covering up abuse and I recall the abduction thing the carton y thing right and there was a show I think my name is Brian you know about the kid who was abducted and then all he remembered I think it's a true story was that his name was Brian he would just remind himself every night about his real name you know I think they found him eventually in Berkeley mhm not calling out Berkeley I lived in Berkeley for a long time but um seemed to be the discovery of of Abu of abducted kid excuse me in Berkeley uh there are a few other cases there I don't know what that's about um in any of I grew up thinking that you could get kidnapped right yeah which yeah which is so it's I mean it's the most terrifying possibility for any parent um but when I was doing the research for the codling the American mind I found according to FBI statistics there's only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings a year in our whole country because if a child like who would take a child like it's a really difficult crime and you're going to you know who would steal a child from a store you know parents are afraid if your kid goes to the next D on the grocery store going to be how are you going to take a kicking and screaming kid out of a store um it's and yet sorry to interrupt but the show America's Most Wanted I believe was hosted by a guy whose kid was abducted and eventually found dead exactly Adam that's right right so so there was this propagation of this fear like that one of the deepest fears of any parent I can to imagine is is is that that's right but the point is that these crimes are extraordinarily rare it's almost always the non-custodial parent who takes a kid it's a family member because there's a fight within the family um so we fear the wrong things we're terrified of kidnapping um but locking our kids up overprotecting them has spiked the suicide rate so much that the death toll is vastly higher from the extra suicides than it would be if we could completely wipe out kidnapping which again doesn't"]

Answer: 

Smartphone use has been associated with several potential harmful changes across various aspects of life. These can be broadly categorized into mental health, physical health, and social behavior impacts.

In terms of mental health, there's evidence of increased rates of depression, especially among young girls. The constant exposure to social media and the potential for negative interactions or comparisons can contribute to this. Anxiety is another concern, possibly due to the constant connectivity and pressure to respond or engage online. There's also a risk of developing attention deficits, with studies showing that even moderate smartphone use (60 minutes per day for adolescents, possibly up to 2 hours for adults) can lead to significant attentional issues.

Physical health concerns include disrupted sleep patterns, partly due to blue light exposure from screens at night. There's also a potential for decreased physical activity and time spent outdoors, as more time is devoted to smartphone use. Interestingly, some research suggests that smartphone use might negatively impact male fertility, with studies indicating a decline in sperm quality associated with mobile phone use, regardless of usage time.

Social behavior changes are notable as well. There's a trend towards less in-person interaction, with people often engaging with their phones even when physically present with others. This can lead to what's termed "solitude deprivation," where individuals rarely experience periods free from stimuli created by other human minds, potentially leading to cognitive exhaustion and increased anxiety.

Additionally, smartphones have changed how young people interact and engage in risky behaviors. While not inherently causing these behaviors, smartphones provide easier access and platforms for sharing or promoting such activities, potentially amplifying their impact.

It's important to note that research in this area is ongoing, as widespread smartphone use is a relatively recent phenomenon. While these potential harmful changes are concerning, more long-term studies are needed to fully understand the impacts of smartphone use on various aspects of human health and behavior.

over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep", "There are some studies\nand one in particular that I'd like to highlight one was actually carried\nout pretty early in 2014.\n\nThis is a study that\nexplored smartphone use at the time they called\nit mobile phone use, but smartphone use and inattention, difficulties in attending\nin 7,102 adolescents that's a huge study, a population based cross-sectional study and you will be probably\nsurprised and somewhat dismayed to hear that in order\nto avoid this decrease in attentional capacity, adolescents needed to use their smartphone for less than 60 minutes per day, in order to stay focused and\ncentered on their other tasks.\n\nOtherwise they started to really run into significant issues.\n\nSo 60 minutes is not much, I've a feeling that most young people are using their phone more\nthan 60 minutes per day, I know I am.\n\nI think for adults, the number's probably higher\nmeaning if you're an adult, I'm going to just extrapolate\nfrom what I read in this study.\n\nIt seems that probably two\nhours a day on the phone would be the upper limit beyond which you would probably experience pretty severe attentional deficits.", "yep there's additional blue light exposure there's just so much to it exactly so if we pull all that together for the time being and put it in a basket of smart phone use and maybe we'll we'll pull out each of those variables one by one as we go forward what are the numbers in 2012 in terms of how much time girls maybe you can give us an age range are spending with the smartphone was it they got the smartphone and immediately we're spending six to eight hours a day on the thing or has it been gradual so let's let's start with the time the time variable sure okay so first the way you put it is actually very helpful um what I want listeners to imagine let's say like imagine on the left left side of a slide I haven't made this slide I'm formulating in my head imagine on the left side of the slide a whole bunch of harmful changes if you're getting less sleep that's bad if you're having blue light at night that's bad if you're not going out in nature that's bad if you are sedentary if you so so imagine about you know 15 different things", "so I I point to that it's that 5-year period 2010 to 2015 which I've called the Great rewiring of childhood because it affects everything everything about what children and teenagers are doing I can recall in 2010 I was actually in New York City visiting friends I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting yeah nowadays I think of it less as addicting but almost um like an an OCD of sorts and here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD but the interesting thing about OCD is that the compulsions the behaviors don't serve to reduce the obsessions rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them and in many ways I feel like smartphone use and social media use in particular is a OCD of sorts it's not just habit it's not just an addiction it's an obsessive compulsive Loop so it's already a struggle to pay attention and you know ancient Traditions have have taught techniques to improve your focus your attention we're easily distracted and um you know so I don't work on my phone very much because I I hate to type on the phone and and I'm always at a computer but even for me sitting at my computer as soon as the thinking gets hard as soon as if I'm writing if I'm doing something that requires concentration some little part of my brain says I wonder what the weather's going to be and I go check the weather or you know oh did I get any email I go check my I might check my email you know probably 40 50 times a day and I know that's terrible so the question is is it a compulsion where I feel pulled I have to check it or something bad will happen no it's more like imagine trying to do your work imagine trying to be a kid in school and you have on your desk in front of you you have your television set your record player a walkie talk to talk to your friends a guitar a painting set all array in front of you and your teacher is telling you about you know geometry what are you going to do probably one of these things and so I think the smartphone where a flip phone it's it's a tool you pull it out if you want to talk to someone then you put it away but the smartphone there's no reason to ever put it away talk to us about the scary statistics there's just no way around this yeah", "but but for one of the other negative effects right so we have the positive effects you talked about which is consolidation of learning and acceleration of learning we had the one negative effect which was the pavlovian connection to distraction the other I've written about before is Solitude deprivation right so so I'm using a different definition of solitude than the colloquial one most people think of it as a physical thing I'm I'm just isolated but there's a there's a cognitive psychological definition of solitude which means absence of stimuli created by other human Minds right so I'm not taking in information that's coming directly from another human mind uh having no period with this Solitude so having no period in your day where your free from stimuli creative from other Minds is Solitude deprivation and it's a real issue and partially it's a real issue because when we're processing input from another human brain it's all hands- on Deck right I mean we're very social beings a huge portion of our brain is dedicated to this right um so it's a very cognitively expensive activity when I'm trying to understand another human's what they're saying I'm simulating their mental state I'm trying to understand like where do they fall in this sort of social hierarchy and one of my arguments was um when you spend your entire day in that state it's exhausting and anxiety producing and like until we had smartphones and ubiquitous wireless internet the idea that you could banish all Solitude from your day is laughable it's just impossible right so of course we had a lot of portions of our day where our brain was not like ramped up in gear four like the sort of social processing mode but smartphones makes it possible that you can be in that mode all day long and so like one of the things I hypothesize is some of the anxiety Rises that goes with the age of smartphones is brain exhaustion right so that's like that's another negative effect of the const we have two negative effects now for the constant stimuli and one positive effect for the absence of the constant stimula so I think we're making a case here for not always being on your device", "Look, it's very\nclear that avoiding

the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical

there's becoming more shallow there's uh conflicts with your so there's a whole bunch and then we want to look at the causal connections and what I'm trying to draw out is suppose you we suppose we could quantify the degree to which sheer time just spending five hours a day does that make you more anxious automatically well maybe a little um but that's probably not the main effect so there's a gigantic multicausal network of effects now um I have good numbers for how much the how much teenss are using these devices and these platforms today um Pew in particular did has done a great job of

Answer: 

Compulsive behavior in addiction is primarily fueled by the dopamine system and its interaction with social isolation. Dopamine plays a crucial role in addiction by driving craving, motivation, and the pursuit of rewarding experiences. In the context of addiction, there's a progressive narrowing of the things that bring pleasure, leading to a compulsive focus on the addictive substance or behavior.

When individuals experience social isolation, it triggers a unique response in the brain, particularly in the dorsal raphe nucleus. This brain region contains dopamine neurons that, when activated, induce a loneliness-like state. This activation motivates the seeking out of social connections, essentially creating a "social hunger." Paradoxically, when these neurons are inhibited, it suppresses the feeling of loneliness.

The relationship between dopamine and isolation in addiction is complex. Social isolation can increase social craving, which is mediated by dopamine release. This craving for social interaction can be so intense that it activates similar brain areas as those associated with addictive substances. In fact, when socially isolated individuals are exposed to social cues, there's an increased activation in brain areas associated with dopaminergic neurons.

Interestingly, this dopamine-driven craving for social interaction can lead to alternative behaviors if social needs aren't met. For example, socially isolated individuals might turn to food as a source of comfort, as both social interaction and food can trigger dopamine release through common neural circuits.

In the context of addiction, this interplay between dopamine and isolation can fuel compulsive behavior in several ways:

1. The addictive substance or behavior becomes the primary source of dopamine release, replacing healthy social interactions.

2. Social isolation can exacerbate the craving for the addictive substance or behavior, as the brain seeks alternative sources of dopamine.

3. The progressive narrowing of pleasure-inducing activities, characteristic of addiction, can lead to further social isolation, creating a vicious cycle.

4. The dopamine system's plasticity means that repeated exposure to addictive substances can cause powerful changes in the reward circuitry, making it increasingly difficult to find pleasure in other activities, including social interactions.

Understanding this relationship between dopamine, isolation, and compulsive behavior is crucial for developing effective addiction treatments and prevention strategies. It highlights the importance of social support and connection in recovery processes, as healthy social interactions can provide an alternative source of dopamine release and help break the cycle of addiction.

just say this you don't have to think about any of those details or names or anything let's just think about addiction because in biology and in Psychology frankly it really often pays to think about the extremes first and then work our way towards more typical circumstances and with that said addiction unfortunately is very common nowadays I just heard a statistic in fact that there is an 8080 percent increase in alcohol use disorder among women in the last 30 years I talked a little bit about this in the episode that I did about alcohol and health again I want to be very clear I'm not somebody that is completely against alcohol for adults provided they're not alcoholics turns out two drinks a week probably fine health-wise zero would be better if we're honest zero is better than any alcohol but two drinks a week is probably fine past two drinks you start running into problems and yet many many people out there male and female alike suffer from alcohol use disorder also called alcoholism the same is also true for things like methamphetamine or cocaine or other types of substance addictions and the same is also true for a lot of Behavioral or what are sometimes called process addictions things like sex addiction or video game addiction or any type of behavior that frankly is leveraging the dopamine system but that engages this Progressive narrowing of the things that bring someone pleasure such that nothing else is really Salient nothing else is really pulling them in in the way that they're video games or sex or pornography or alcohol pick your substance or you know behavior that you see out there or hopefully not but that you might suffer from an addiction too so what's happening in addiction well addiction involves dopamine among other things often the opioid system Etc", "Here's the thing, when dopamine is higher\nin your brain and body, when you've deployed it through excitement or pharmacology or otherwise, it tends to narrow your focus\nand make you seek more of it in that general theme that\nyou happen to be focused on.\n\nIt could be anything.\n\nThat's the scary thing about dopamine.\n\nWhat can you do to control\nit and to reduce it?\n\nWell, for those of you\nthat are engaging in habits that are healthy, maybe that doesn't\nrequire reducing dopamine.\n\nHow do you define\nhealthy versus unhealthy?\n\nWell, I think the simplest\nway to define addiction, at least by my mind, is that addiction is a\nprogressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure.\n\nAnd a good life is a progressive expansion of the things that bring you pleasure.\n\nA rather simple definition, and yet when we think about\nthe biology of dopamine, dopamine is not unique to one pursuit.\n\nIt's not unique to the pursuit of sex or the pursuit of warmth when you're cold or cool environments when you're too warm or food or social media, it's just a dumb molecule that puts you into this forward state of\nmass, small visual aperture, and a kind of obsessive-like nature.\n\nWhat can you do to counter that?", "And we know from Rob Malenka's\nwork, who's here at Stanford, that oxytocin, you know, is the hormone that's\ninvolved in human pair bonding and relationships and love.\n\nAnd it directly links to dopamine neurons and causes the release of dopamine.\n\nSo yes, when we connect with other humans, especially in a kind of\ntranscendent spiritual way, that's a huge dopamine hit.\n\nAnd it does replace the dopamine\nthat people get from drugs.\n\nAnd for people who have\nthis addiction temperament, they need it on a more intense level.\n\nThey're not going to be\ngenerally satisfied with kind of, you know, a sort of\nacquaintanceship, right?\n\nThey want that intensity of\nthe intimacy that you get with people when you're\ncathartically exposing, you know, warts and all.\n\nSo yes, people can get\naddicted to recovery, and good for them.\n\nGo for it, you know.\n\nAnd of course this can be disruptive for friendships and relationships, where the one person is not in recovery.\n\nLike you're going to so many meetings, you're always talking about\nrecovery, but you know what, much better than them\nbeing intoxicated, right?\n\nI mean, so although you\nmay tire of your friends talking about their meetings all the time, I'm sure you would\nrather have them do that than, you know, be in their addictions.", "A side question is, the huge question\nis, why do some people develop an addiction problem and others who\nhave used this substance just don't?\n\nAnd again, as a world class neuroscientist\nyourself, you know the answer.\n\nIt's always a complex combination of\nunderlying genetics, the environment in which they find themselves, the\nenvironment in which they grew up, and how that modified their reward circuitry.\n\nSo, to get at your question, one set\nof experiments my lab did, which other labs did, too, I don't deserve the sole\ncredit for this, is showing that drugs of abuse cause powerful plasticity\nin the neurons that make up the cells that make up the reward circuitry.\n\nAnd in fact, drugs of abuse, like\ncocaine, methamphetamine, opioids like morphine, heroin, change the synapses.\n\nThe synapses are the connections from\nother nerve cells onto dopamine neurons, onto the nerve cells and the accumbens.\n\nAnd these connections,\nthese synapses, can change.\n\nAnd drugs of abuse cause powerful\nchanges in those connections, and therefore, powerful changes in the\nactivity of the dopamine neurons and the neurons in the nucleus accumbens.\n\nAnd, in fact, the types of changes that\noccur appear to be similar to the types of changes that have evolved for good uses\nfor adaptive forms of learning and memory.\n\nSo, again, this is an example that\nthis superficially simple dopamine reward circuitry is changing all\nthe time, and it's highly plastic and can become more sensitive to\ncertain experiences, etc, etc.", "There's a key finding in the literature, the title of this paper is Dorsal Raphe Dopamine Neurons Represent the Experience of Social Isolation.\n\nThis is a paper from Kat Tye's lab, the first author is Matthews, Gillian Matthews to be specific.\n\nWhat they did is they were\nable to selectively activate the dopamine neurons in\nthe dorsal raphe nucleus.\n\nAnd when they did that, they induced a loneliness-like state.\n\nNow, how did they know it\nwas a loneliness-like state?\n\nThey knew because it motivated the seeking out of social connections.\n\nThis is the kind of social hunger that I was referring to before.\n\nWhereas when the dopamine\nneurons of the dorsal raphe are inhibited, meaning\ntheir activity is quieted that suppressed a loneliness state.\n\nSo that's a little\ncounterintuitive, right?\n\nIt's a group of neurons\nthat when activated makes you feel lonely, and when this brain area is not activated, it suppresses loneliness.\n\nBut if you think about it, that's exactly the kind of\ncircuit that you would want in order to drive social behavior.\n\nWhen you're feeling lonely, dopamine is released and\nit causes you to go out and seek social interactions.\n\nWhen this brain area has\nenough social interactions, that's sort of a figure of speech, brain areas don't have\nenough social interactions, but when enough social\ninteractions have happened, that the neurons in this brain areas shut down their production of dopamine.", "Dopamine is a neuromodulator most often associated with movement, craving, motivation and desire.\n\nAnd the neural circuits\nthat are rich with dopamine are things like the substantia nigra, the mesolimbic dopamine system, the VTA, the nucleus accumbens, et cetera.\n\nThose names don't have\nto mean anything to you.\n\nHowever, this unique\npopulation of dopamine neurons in the raphe is truly unique in that it's responsible for mediating what I've been calling social homeostasis.\n\nIt is the effector or the response that mediate social homeostasis.\n\nNow I haven't told you exactly\nwhat social homeostasis is.\n\nSocial homeostasis, just like hunger, is the process by which when\nyou lack social interaction, you start to crave it.\n\nWhat's very interesting about the fact that there are dopamine\nneurons in this raphe structure that is the effector\nfor social homeostasis, what this means is that\nwhen you are not interacting with people at a frequency or intensity, that is right for you, dopamine is released into the brain.\n\nIn most popular\nconversations about dopamine, and even in scientific circles, when you hear dopamine release, you think about reward or feeling good, because indeed many behaviors and drugs of abuse increase dopamine.\n\nThat's one of the reasons they have so much addictive potential.\n\nHowever, dopamine is not\nassociated with feeling good, it is actually the neurochemical that's responsible for movement toward things that feel good.", "well then we consider it adaptive if it's not well then considered maladaptive some people will sit down to play a video game they really like video games and as they're sitting down they will experience a five-fold increase in the rate of dopamine output from their nucleus accumbens for other people it's going to be a tenfold increase for other people like me who don't like video games very much I don't have anything against them I don't dislike them but it doesn't do much for me it might not cause any increase whatsoever it might even cause a decrease in dopamine so there's a lot of individual variability for sex it turns out to be a range so the typical range that's cited in the literature is anywhere from a four to five-fold increase in the rate of dopamine neuron firing however there are certain individuals for which that number is doubled caffeine is a little bit of a special circumstance because caffeine has the property of not just causing the release of dopamine but increasing the amount of dopamine receptors over time and there aren't a lot of excellent measurements of the amount of dopamine released as a function of caffeine intake in different populations of humans it's mostly animal studies but what we think based on the Gestalt based on the overall picture of the literature is that it's an approximate doubling of the dopamine signaling that's coming out of the VTA nucleus accumens to prefrontal Cortex when we anticipate and when we drink our coffee again I really want to be clear that for all of these things these are relative levels and they are distribution so if we were to plot them out on paper you would see that these are not bar graphs these are overlapping curves to some extent so some people are going to achieve more dopamine release or less dopamine release from one Behavior or substance however it's very clear that cocaine methamphetamine even heroin for that matter are way out on the right hand side of the curve causing enormous increases in dopamine very quickly and the other things that we described have again a distribution that is more leftward shifted on this imaginary plot that I'm creating it's a lot of individual variability however it's fascinating that dopamine is the single molecule that's causing the craving and pursuit and experience of all of these substances and behaviors and the learning of all of that craving Pursuit and actual experience is what predicts whether or not we will re-engage reuse that substance or not re-engage in a behavior or not and how frequently we will do that so that's addiction but if you understand how the height of those peaks in dopamine and the rate to reach those Peaks and the troughs that result and how long the troughs take to get back to Baseline if you understand or a little or all of that you're really in a terrific position to understand how to Leverage The dopamine system for the pursuit of healthy goals and behaviors I should mention one thing about recovery from addiction which is that the reset of all that dopamine circuitry from unhealthy to healthy often involves depending on the addiction 30 days of complete abstinence that 30 days of complete abstinence inevitably involves a lot of pain and discomfort and craving anxiety insomnia Etc that relates to the big trough in dopamine that inevitably occurs now of course there are some addictions such as severe alcohol addiction and in some cases opiate addiction that immediate and sustained abstinence cannot be used as the tool somebody really needs to work with an addiction specialist and sometimes there needs to be a tapering off of the substance for other addictions it can be quote unquote cold turkey and then of course there are other addictions particularly food and sex but sometimes even things like video games for which the desired outcome is not necessarily to eliminate the behavior completely but to set some constraints around the behavior so that it's not occurring to the exclusion of other pleasureful things in life and adaptive things in life and for that there is the requirement for what are called binding behaviors we'll get back to binding behaviors later but binding behaviors or behaviors in which people bind their behavior around a particular substance use or around a particular behavioral addiction like sex Video Games Etc in space and or time in space meaning they might only engage in those particular behaviors in certain places and certain times when it's context appropriate there are numerous examples of binding behaviors in space and time it all has to do with clamping or directing when the engagement with the dopamine releasing behavior is going to occur so what's happening when people decide to go cold turkey or they use these binding behaviors well what's happening is that people are engaging the specific circuitry within the prefrontal cortex that as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode are important for context setting so in the cases of binding behaviors the prefrontal cortex is essentially getting trained up to understand that okay certain things like food or perhaps sex or perhaps video games they're okay if they are done or consumed in appropriate amounts or in particular context that requires the context setting goal directed behavior that the prefrontal cortex is responsible", 'But thought of from the different side, you could also imagine how well, if you\'re getting\na social interaction with somebody on a daily or weekly basis, and suddenly you remove that interaction, well, then people might not care, they might just think, well, I\'ll get the interaction tomorrow or the next day or the next day, because they\'re sated, much in the same way that the person who eats very regularly might say, "Well, I ate four hours ago, and I\'ll eat eight hours\nlater, no big deal."\n\nBut that\'s not what happens.\n\nThere\'s a prediction\nthat we are going to have certain types of interactions, and when those interactions don\'t happen, we replace that lack of\ninteraction with a drive and a motivation to seek\nout social interaction.\n\nAnd that drive and\nmotivation is caused by, or I should say, is driven by dopamine release\nfrom that dorsal raphe.\n\nAnd so the takeaway is that\nwhen we lack social interaction that we expect, we become pro-social.\n\nHowever, if we are\nchronically socially isolated, meaning we don\'t have interactions with people for a long time, we become actually more introverted.', "Andrew Huberman: What I'm asking here,\nqueuing up in the back of your mind, is whether or not addiction is just\nrelated to the sensation that we have when we indulge in a behavior, or\nwhen we are under the influence of a drug, or whether or not it actually\nmodifies neural circuitry in a way that makes a broader range of drugs\nor experiences attractive to us.", "It's actually very interesting, it has everything to do with whether or not they were formerly\naddicted to something else but in any case, the\nway that addiction works and the way that\nmotivation works generally in the non-addictive setting is that when you anticipate something a little bit of dopamine\nis released, and then when you reach that thing,\nyou're engaged in that thing the amount of dopamine\ngoes up even further but as you repeatedly pursue a behavior and you repeatedly engage\nwith a particular thing let's say you love running or you love chocolate as\nyou eat a piece of chocolate believe it or not, it tastes good and then there's a shift away\nfrom activation of dopamine.\n\nAnd there are other\nchemicals that are released that trigger a low level sense of pain.\n\nNow you might not feel it as physical pain but the craving that you feel is both one part dopamine and one part, the mirror image of dopamine which is the pain or the craving for yet\nanother piece of chocolate.\n\nAnd this is a very important and subtle feature of the dopamine system.\n\nThat's not often discussed.", "Andrew Huberman: Yeah, the way\nyou described it is exactly right.\n\nThose programs are highly reinforcing for\nabstinence behaviors, everything from the social connection, which we're going to\nget to social connection, as you know, to the way that people start to conceptualize\ntheir addict self versus other self.\n\nIt actually involves a splitting\nof the self in interesting ways.\n\nAs long as we're talking about\ndonuts, cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine.\n\nI'm curious, before we move to a bit\nmore on neuroplasticity, is there anything that people ought to know about\nhow different substances and behaviors that are addicting might impact the\ndopamine reward circuitry differently?\n\nSo, for instance, we talked about\ncocaine as having this very rapid onset, big increase in dopamine, then\na crash, as we know, a certain pattern of kinetics, as you describe it, the\nopioid crisis is incredibly serious problem right now, as is methamphetamine.\n\nBut it sounds like methamphetamine\nfunctions a bit like cocaine.\n\nAnd in terms of its kinetics, yes.\n\nSo an opioid is a very different\nchemical than cocaine, but it sounds like it impacts the dopamine system.\n\nIs the dopaminergic activity caused\nby opioids responsible for the addictive properties of opioids?\n\nOr do people also like the\nfeeling of being under opioids?"]

Ground Truths: ['Compulsive behavior in addiction is fueled by dopamine overshoot, where individuals feel bad when not engaging in the addictive activity. This leads to compulsive use, similar to gambling addiction, where the individual believes that the next engagement could change everything, causing motivated reasoning and dashed hopefulness. Additionally, as social lives move onto video games, porn, and social media, loneliness and anxiety increase, leading to a search for cheap and easy stimulation that ultimately is not satisfying.']

Answer: 

Real-world adventures play a crucial role in boosting kids' independence and creating lasting memories. These experiences provide children with opportunities for unstructured play time, which is essential for their mental health and development.

When children engage in real-world adventures, they learn valuable skills that contribute to their independence. For instance, they discover how to negotiate situations with other kids, resolve conflicts, and collaborate. These interactions help them recognize social cues and develop emotional intelligence, which are critical for building independence.

Adventures in the real world also create powerful, lasting memories. As Dr. Jonathan Haidt points out, exciting and sometimes scary things happen during these experiences, leading to memorable moments that children carry with them into adulthood. These memories often become shared experiences that friends continue to discuss years later.

Importantly, real-world adventures offer a level of excitement and thrills that virtual experiences simply cannot match. While digital activities like video games may seem engaging, they don't provide the same depth of experience or opportunity for personal growth. As Haidt notes, "the virtual adventures are just not going to cut it."

To foster these beneficial experiences, parents and communities can take several approaches:

1. Encourage unstructured play time outdoors, allowing children to explore their neighborhoods and interact with peers.
2. Provide opportunities for independence, such as letting older children navigate public transportation or explore areas like amusement parks with minimal supervision.
3. Enroll children in summer camps that ban phones, offering a chance for detox and immersion in real-world activities.
4. Support participation in team sports, which not only provide physical activity but also foster cooperation and social skills.

By prioritizing these real-world adventures and unstructured play time, we can help children develop independence, create lasting memories, and build the social and emotional skills necessary for their future success.

is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real world because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing we have to do is restore a really fun adventurous childhood like you know what you were saying you know you go out on your bicycle you're hanging out with your friends friends sometimes something happens and boy you have memories I mean exciting things happen scary things happen you have memories and you know I worry about like what you know what boys today you know I have a group of Buddy my group of friends that I you know we we still talk about things that happened you know things that amazing things that happened when we were in college or after college and I wonder

getting you guys outside um my parents did the same thing too like we I was very blessed to have two parents who didn't come you know they didn't have a lot of resources growing up they didn't come to this country with a lot of resources but the one of the greatest gifts they G gave us is that they loved us uncondition Al the other great gift that they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out", "look you guys actually you can see what this is doing to you you mostly agree that this is wasting your time it's garbage you you want to way out but you just feel like you can't there's such resignation um but look the cool kids over there they have flip phones and they're out like every day after school they're like you know they're doing stuff they're down at you know they're in the mall they're they're getting pizza they're you know building a fort uh you know whatever depending on the age um so I think the way out is to give kids an exciting childhood kids are so lonely now and and they they don't have much in the way of Adventure they don't have much in the way of Thrills um you know you know I live I live in New York City um you know I would start I would like bring my kids out to Coney Island when they were you know 9 10 years old bring them out and then I would just say I'm just going to sit here you guys run around you guys go have fun like I'm not going to be with you you know you know yeah there's a chance you'll get kidnapped or struck by lightning although lightning is more likely um so and then it you know and then it got once they were you know in more you know like like 13 now they can actually take the subway out to Coney Island with a friend so um that's cool", "but I worry that right now that we've almost somehow made that kind of unstructured time seem inefficient you know we've set these standards uh for our kids that they need to be uh you know getting fancy jobs and into fancy colleges and making an x amount of money and the path to doing that is you know to be enrolled in X number of activities after school and to do all this stuff in school and their lives are so hyper structured um that I worry that the time to just play to be creative to reflect and think to just have unstructured time with other kids has evaporated and I think that that also is hurting the mental health and wellbeing of our children I love the idea that that unstructured play time could be framed in the accurate context of the nervous system developing the way it was supposed to develop I mean I would argue that um success is going to be easiest for children that engage in the real world more in fact there's great risk to posting everything that you do online we've seen some examples of that preventing people from getting into or staying in college based on things they said or did previously that they shouldn't have said or done um that's those are kind of you know negative highlighted cases but in general um we know that the the nervous system thrives on diversity of types of interactions and social interactions in particular I'm just restating what you just said", "I mean it's crazy what happens so eight states have now said no no more of that this is insane um so we so law could help to put to to stop incentivizing helicopter parenting to provide uh uh more spaces that are safe for kids to play in not car zones um so the book has the exas generation the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "So the first gate is to arrive at learning at the appropriate level\nof autonomic arousal.\n\nClear and focused is best, but don't obsess over being\nright there, it's okay.\n\nIf you're a

the learning will be accelerated.\n\nSo there's really four things\nthat you really need to do for plasticity as an adult.\n\nAnd I would say that these\nalso apply to young people.\n\nAnd there's an interesting kind of a thought\nexperiment there as well, which is if you look at children, they are moving a lot\nin different dimensions.\n\nThey are sometimes hanging from trees.\n\nMy sports were always\nthings where I tended to get hurt a lot, fall a lot.\n\nSo it's skateboarding for\nme when I was younger, so a lot of falling and rolling and various things of that sort.\n\nBut whatever sport the kids are playing, or even if they don't play a sport, they tend to move in a lot of different relationships to gravity, more dimensionality to their\nmovements I should say, than adults.", "um the British have a saying don't put your daughter on the stage Mrs Worthington uh which is a line from an old nol coward song and it acknowledges that especially for girls for girls to grow up being

so yes in response to your question first summer camps are magic never send your child to a summer camp that doesn't ban phones because this is the best chance you have for a detox and I hear the story over and over again you know my I get my my girl got a an iPhone when she was was 11 she suddenly became sirly no longer the sweet funny child she was I sent her to summer camp the next summer and lo and behold the girl that comes back is my wonderful sweet 11-year-old you know she her personality is back and then she gets back on her phone and she becomes Surly again so summer camps are the most powerful technique known um for a detox because the kid isn't being deprived they are in a bunk with other kids with no phones and they're joking and talking and laughing and fighting and doing all those healthy things so summer camp is amazing the other thing that the evidence shows is that team sports and religion those two things are very very protective so I would strongly urge people um to encourage their kids to play team sports my kids run trap which is great but team sports Force more cooperation so there's some evidence that team sports are even better for their mental

on Friday no nothing on Friday Fridays you all get together you can start at anyone's house go out do what you want we'll even you know we'll give you you know we'll give you more allowance or we'll give you money to spend but go have experiences then it's fun it's not deprivation I love the uh trust in kids to sort things out and to be safe enough um at least the statistics say that they're more likely to thrive under those conditions than to be kidnapped or have something terrible happen I I like it also because it merges uh your previous book codling of the American mind um with the current book The anxious generation"]

Answer: 

COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) set the age for minors in contracts and data sharing at 13 years old. This law was passed in 1998 and was originally intended to set the age at 16, which was considered more reasonable. However, it was pushed down to 13 with little enforcement.

This age limit of 13 does not align well with today's views on kids' social media access. Many experts and parents now believe that 13 is too young for unrestricted social media use. For instance, Dr. Jonathan Haidt recommends delaying social media access until age 16, citing concerns about brain development and the potential negative impacts on mental health.

The current situation creates several problems:

1. Lack of enforcement: The law is written in a way that companies are not held responsible as long as they don't explicitly know a user is underage. This motivates platforms to avoid verifying users' ages accurately.

2. Ease of circumvention: Children can easily lie about their age to access social media platforms, as there's no robust age verification system in place.

3. Developmental concerns: At 13, the brain, particularly the prefrontal cortex, is still developing. This makes younger teens more vulnerable to the negative effects of social media.

4. Social pressure: With the current age limit, there's significant pressure on children to join social media platforms earlier than may be healthy for them.

Many experts, including Dr. Haidt, are now advocating for raising the age limit to 16 and implementing stronger age verification measures. This aligns more closely with current understanding of adolescent development and the potential risks associated with early social media use.

The discrepancy between the COPPA age limit and current views highlights the need for updated legislation and enforcement to better protect children's well-being in the digital age.

any attempt to regulate social media or any attempt to sue them is seen as like no no", "so I think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here too cuz Andrew my big concern with parents is look we've taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which we didn't grow up with as kids and we've told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this um you know when we were growing up you remember the motor vehicle fatalities were really high uh in America and we didn't say okay you know what that's just the price of Modern Life we just have to accept it and keep moving on with our lives we said hold on we don't have to go back to horses and Buggies but we also don't need to accept this death rate we need to make this experience safer and so we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups like Matt and others across the country that me Mothers Against Drunk Driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts airbags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that help helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents and deaths and that's what we need here too like we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting in place safety standards to protect kids from exposure to harmful content from from the experience of bullying and harassment and that also protect them from features that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use uh which is happening far too often right now we also need a policy that requires data transparency from the company you know researchers tell us all the time that they these are independent researchers they tell us they are having a hard time getting full access to the data from the social media platforms about the full impact of the platforms on the mental health of kids and as a parent look I I don't when we bought car seats for my children when when they were born we looked up the safety data like many parents we wanted to make sure the car seats were safe but if you had told me that hey you know the manufacturers of these car seats are actually not disclosing some of the the data on the impact on children uh but go ahead and buy it anyway", "oh these terrible devices um rather it's about a vision of childhood which is actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the reason why I got this far is because it's a set of collective action traps everyone every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone so the four recommendations I have are four ways of breaking out on the Trap but the first two are really about delaying and getting past this period of plasticity and you really help me see why it's so urgent to delay until late puberty at least so here are the four Norms that I think can break us out of this trap Norm number one uh no smartphone before high school you can give your kid a flip phone flip the Millennials had flip phones they came out fine no access or no smartphone of their own your own you can't have your own and that would even go for an iPad if you give your kid an iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it any you know anywhere in the house and you can take it outside even although maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the point is um the internet is an amazing thing and you know you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids and they can do things on the computer but you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to so it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone let them have a flip phone or a simple phone watch something like that that's rule number one rule number two is the most relevant for what we're just talking about and that is no social media until 16 there is I believe no way to make social media safe for children that is if they're going to be entering a domain in which Prestige is gained by having posts that get the most likes and followers you're making them be brand managers you're making them be performative this is not playful th", 'So,\n- Right.', "It's like-\n- Right. - Well-\n-", 'Like so-\n-', "but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media", '- Yeah-\n-', 'But-\n-', "but they haven't been the other is the sharing and we used to hear about pod parties where somebody buys the device which is more expensive buys the device and then you bring your own not beer bring your own pod which is a few dollars then you pop it in and then you share it around um we've also heard stories of a few teenagers buying them and then selling for a few cents or a few dollars a puff so meet me in the bathroom for 50 cents or a dollar you can have a couple of Puffs so I think teens are getting very very creative we've also seen unfortunately parents buying e cigarettes for their teens well at least they're not smoking cigarettes that's not the right comparison um so I think they're very creative they're getting into many many different ways I've heard students say I'm not using my lunch money to buy lunch I'm going to use it to buy Vapes um there's no one way uh there's not and unfortunately access is easier than it should by the way one thing I think is incredibly important for people to understand is across the US in 2019 December 2019 the legal age to be allowed to purchase or to sell nicotine products across the US is is become 21 so many people think it's so 18"]

Ground Truths: ["COPPA set the age for minors in contracts and data sharing at 13. This aligns with today's views on kids' social media access as there is a push to raise the age to 16, with concerns that the current age of 13 is not enforced and allows children to access social media without proper age verification."]

Answer: 

The purpose of implementing phone-free schools is multifaceted and aims to address several key issues related to student learning, development, and well-being.

Firstly, phone-free schools are designed to improve learning and focus. By removing smartphones from the classroom environment, students are better able to concentrate on their lessons and engage with the material being taught. This is particularly important given that smartphones are described as "the greatest distraction devices ever invented" and can significantly hinder a student's ability to pay attention to teachers and coursework.

Secondly, phone-free schools aim to reduce constant distractions. The context mentions a teacher who struggled with students constantly using their phones during class, with one student admitting to watching TikTok throughout the entire lesson. By eliminating these devices, schools can create an environment more conducive to learning and skill development.

Thirdly, implementing phone-free schools promotes real-world interactions and experiences. There's a concern that excessive phone use, particularly social media, is replacing valuable in-person social interactions and experiences that are crucial for child development. By removing phones, schools can encourage more face-to-face communication and engagement among students.

Lastly, phone-free schools address mental health concerns associated with excessive smartphone and social media use among young people. The context mentions rising rates of anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues potentially linked to smartphone use, particularly during sensitive developmental periods.

It's worth noting that implementing phone-free schools can be challenging. The context suggests that policies requiring students to keep phones in their pockets are often ineffective, leading to constant conflicts. More stringent measures, such as locking up phones in the morning or using specialized pouches, are recommended for successful implementation.

Overall, the purpose of phone-free schools is to create an environment that supports learning, reduces distractions, promotes real-world social skills, and potentially safeguards students' mental health during critical developmental stages.

Retrieved Contexts: ["so because if if it's true that puberty is a sensitive period for many higher level uh uh aspects of our Humanity such as identity relationship skills all that stuff then you should be extra careful when your kids are 9 to 15 years old you should be extra careful about what's going into their eyes and ears and instead that's when we give up all control you know when our kids are little they pay attention to us we read to them we have a lot of control about what our kids consume when they're toddlers And when they're very young but as they reach middle school and high school they're moving away they're seeking out other stuff and that's exactly what we say here here's your own device you want to go down a rabbit hole of eating disorder stuff you want to go down a rabbit hole of of you know of you know Tourette Syndrome um you're going to copy people who have these symptoms so the last thing we should be doing is exposing our children in this sensitive period to socializing information from random weirdos on the internet who were selected by an algorithm for the extremity of their behavior and the degree to which that extremity earned them likes which makes them extra prestigious um so yeah I laws that raise the age to 16 or 18 I think that's what we need um this is just not appropriate for minors even if there's some good stuff on it I think it's vastly outweighed by the bad so that's and that's the second Norm no smart no social media till 16 uh the third Norm is phone free schools and again you know if we expect kids to learn and learning is brain change if you're learning something you're developing a skill something about your brain has changed uh how about instead of learning math or reading or litter or anything else how about if you just do more phone stuff you just spend more time in school on Tik Tok there was just an article in the Washington in the Wall Street Journal about a teacher who fought against the phones and finally gave up and quit and one of the students in his classes quoted um that she used to she'd come into class and she would just go on Tik Tok and that's what she would do all class long is just watch Tik Tok in her desk um you know and like no you should be learning not doing more Tik Tok in school so it's just insane that we let kids take the greatest distraction devices ever invented into the classroom with them I would argue that they are learning but what they're learning are these rapidly reinforced dopamine Loops that lead to diminished amounts of dopamine not just in short periods of time but very quickly and that inhibit other forms of learning yeah that's right and the ability to pay attention right to to a teacher which is not as stimulating as what you're seeing on Tik Tok there's tons of learning it's but it's learning of all the wrong things that's right that's right", "so that's the third Norm is uh no uh is phonefree schools you have to lock up the phone in the morning either a lock in a phone lock or Yonder pouch um if the policy is you keep in your pocket that's not a policy that's just a recipe for constant conflict with the kids because they can't help it they have to text if anyone's texting they have to be texting and the fourth Norm is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real world because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing we have to do is restore a really fun adventurous childhood like you know what you were saying you know you go out on your bicycle you're hanging out with your friends friends sometimes something happens and boy you have memories I mean exciting things happen scary things happen you have memories and you know I worry about like what you know what boys today you know I have a group of Buddy my group of friends that I you know we we still talk about things that happened you know things that amazing things that happened when we were in college or after college and I wonder what boys young boys today are going to say you know you remember fortnite game 27363 where you were trapped in that Elevator Shaft and I had to shoot you out no I don't remember that one you know like uh the the virtual Adventures are just not going to cut it our kids need Adventure they need Independence and Adventure uh where they work out the conflicts themselves", "so I I point to that it's that 5-year period 2010 to 2015 which I've called the Great rewiring of childhood because it affects everything everything about what children and teenagers are doing I can recall in 2010 I was actually in New York City visiting friends I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting yeah nowadays I think of it less as addicting but almost um like an an OCD of sorts and here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD but the interesting thing about OCD is that the compulsions the behaviors don't serve to reduce the obsessions rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them and in many ways I feel like smartphone use and social media use in particular is a OCD of sorts it's not just habit it's not just an addiction it's an obsessive compulsive Loop so it's already a struggle to pay attention and you know ancient Traditions have have taught techniques to improve your focus your attention we're easily distracted and um you know so I don't work on my phone very much because I I hate to type on the phone and and I'm always at a computer but even for me sitting at my computer as soon as the thinking gets hard as soon as if I'm writing if I'm doing something that requires concentration some little part of my brain says I wonder what the weather's going to be and I go check the weather or you know oh did I get any email I go check my I might check my email you know probably 40 50 times a day and I know that's terrible so the question is is it a compulsion where I feel pulled I have to check it or something bad will happen no it's more like imagine trying to do your work imagine trying to be a kid in school and you have on your desk in front of you you have your television set your record player a walkie talk to talk to your friends a guitar a painting set all array in front of you and your teacher is telling you about you know geometry what are you going to do probably one of these things and so I think the smartphone where a flip phone it's it's a tool you pull it out if you want to talk to someone then you put it away but the smartphone there's no reason to ever put it away talk to us about the scary statistics there's just no way around this yeah", "I will say that a\ngraduate student in my lab who was immensely productive and focused, had the habit of coming in each day, she would take her phone, I\ndon't know if she turned it on, or off or not, and she would\njust place it in a door, excuse me, in a drawer and would then go start doing experiments.\n\nWe do experiments all day at 10 courses, engage in discussions\navidly with the rest of us, and then would take her phone out at the end of the day and leave.\n\nAnd I don't think that\nbehavior was not correlated with her immense productivity.\n\nI think the ability to untether\nourselves from the phone is going to be the way in which many of us are either going to succeed or\nfail in our various pursuits.\n\nI'm somebody who engages on with the phone on a regular basis throughout\nthe day for various reasons, but I do try and have\nlarge swaths of the day in which it's either on airplane mode or it's completely\nphysically separated from me.\n\nWhen I'm in large swaths,\nI might do every other hour with the phone on airplane mode or even a two or three hour\nabout where I just am simply not engaged with the phone at all.", "I I was delighted um it seems to me that if there was an understanding that the biology and psychology and sociology points to the fact that there is a critical period maybe not even a sensitive period but a critical period in which excessive smartphone use of a particular type is actually leading to more suicides depression anxiety and less learning and um adaptive behavior in life it seems to me that it should be a almost like a law it should be implemented at the level certainly at the national level what what sorts of barriers do you think exist to that um you know obviously I'm enthusiastic in joining your effort and and um I know many people listening will be as well to try and Implement these four things but what do you think it would really take to get people to take their children's brains and lives seriously because children can't be left to their own self-care to that degree it's just unfair right I mean it's like telling a kid in a candy shop like Hey listen you know figure it out you know there's nutritious food down the stre like it's unfair right it's like a puppy trying to trying to do the you know Westminster Championship it's like it's not going to happen um you know but this is serious stuff I mean we're talking about the future not just of the United States but of the entire species so um what about laws what about legislature how does that work I don't know anything about that sure well first so you know let's let's note you know I could be wrong about this um it might be that the phones aren't doing this now I think the evidence is pretty good that it is but let's suppose there's a 70% chance that I'm right let's Suppose there was only a 30% chance I was right the the consequences are so severe we should be taking action now what action to take I was over in the UK for the book about three weeks ago and in the UK you know and the rest of Europe the first thought of everyone is Ban it ban it ban it government law ban", "but but for one of the other negative effects right so we have the positive effects you talked about which is consolidation of learning and acceleration of learning we had the one negative effect which was the pavlovian connection to distraction the other I've written about before is Solitude deprivation right so so I'm using a different definition of solitude than the colloquial one most people think of it as a physical thing I'm I'm just isolated but there's a there's a cognitive psychological definition of solitude which means absence of stimuli created by other human Minds right so I'm not taking in information that's coming directly from another human mind uh having no period with this Solitude so having no period in your day where your free from stimuli creative from other Minds is Solitude deprivation and it's a real issue and partially it's a real issue because when we're processing input from another human brain it's all hands- on Deck right I mean we're very social beings a huge portion of our brain is dedicated to this right um so it's a very cognitively expensive activity when I'm trying to understand another human's what they're saying I'm simulating their mental state I'm trying to understand like where do they fall in this sort of social hierarchy and one of my arguments was um when you spend your entire day in that state it's exhausting and anxiety producing and like until we had smartphones and ubiquitous wireless internet the idea that you could banish all Solitude from your day is laughable it's just impossible right so of course we had a lot of portions of our day where our brain was not like ramped up in gear four like the sort of social processing mode but smartphones makes it possible that you can be in that mode all day long and so like one of the things I hypothesize is some of the anxiety Rises that goes with the age of smartphones is brain exhaustion right so that's like that's another negative effect of the const we have two negative effects now for the constant stimuli and one positive effect for the absence of the constant stimula so I think we're making a case here for not always being on your device", "Okay, so we talked about cannabis.\n\nWe talked about alcohol.\n\nLet's talk about cell phones.\n\nFirst of all, I use a cell phone.\n\nI use it very often.\n\nAnd I do not think they are evil devices.\n\nI think that they require some discipline in order to make sure that it does not become a\nnegative force in one's life.\n\nSo I personally restrict\nthe number of hours that I'm on the phone and in\nparticular on social media.\n\nI only answer email at\nparticular times of day.\n\nBut what about the cell phone itself?\n\nYou know, when I was a junior professor.\n\nI was a pre-tenure early professor.\n\nI taught this class on neural circuits in health and disease.\n\nAnd one of the students asked me, you know are cell phones\nsafe for the brain?\n\nAnd you know, all the data point to the fact that they were.\n\nOr at least there were no data showing that it wasn't.\n\nI still don't have the\nanswer on that, frankly.\n\nI don't see a lot of studies about it.", "so yes there is some evidence that overall phones and smartphones have increased risk behavior but it's more the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned", "I mean it's crazy what happens so eight states have now said no no more of that this is insane um so we so law could help to put to to stop incentivizing helicopter parenting to provide uh uh more spaces that are safe for kids to play in not car zones um so the book has the exas generation the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right", "it it's it's cropping up in different ways I'm meeting more and more some of these are organized efforts but I'm also meeting more uh families uh where the parents and kids together have decided that they're going to delay using social media and you know till past middle school or in some cases even later or where they're deciding that they're going to draw boundaries around social media use or they're going to replace their smartphone with a dumb phone that allows them to do things like text and make phone calls and use maps and and all that stuff but doesn't necessarily have social media apps on it now this is still a small minority and and we're dealing with a bit of a network effect here right because if you're the only one who's not on social media uh in your middle school class then you might feel left out which is why it's so important for parents to and and kids actually do this together", "Now in the digital realm,\nI already mentioned a few of the things that we\ncan do as practical tools to limit interruptions.\n\nOne is use the program Freedom, the other would be to\nsimply turn off the wifi.\n\nIf you do need to be\nonline and navigating, you're doing research of any kind, that's not going to be possible.\n\nTurning off one's phone, I've at times, put my phone on airplane\nmode, if that didn't work, I've locked it in a safe, I've done that, I'd left in the car outside.\n\nIt all depends on one's\nlevels of self-discipline, which as you probably know,\nfrom your own experience, tends to kind of wax and wane.\n\nSometimes we are better at avoiding these\ndistractions than others.\n\nSo if you find yourself in\na place where it's very hard to reduce those distractions, you may need you to go\nto more elaborate lanes.", "Danielle says, the top three\nmost impactful things schools could do to raise student\ncapacity for learning?\n\nWhat a great question.\n\nWell, I'll add a\nfourth because I don't want to try and\nwriggle out of the question by just saying sleep again.\n\nBut I think trying to\nget kids to sleep enough is going to be key.\n\nSo that means off\nphones and iPads in the middle of the night.\n\nThat means starting\nschool a little bit later.\n\nI don't know if that's\never going to work.\n\nBut that would be\na marvelous thing for learning because\nas you know, or we all should know or remember,\nneuroplasticity and learning is triggered by focused attention,\nwhich is supported by having slept well the night before.\n\nBut the actual rewiring of\nneural connections occurs when?\n\nIt occurs during sleep, it\noccurs during deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.\n\nThat's when the reorganization\nof neural connections occurs, the strengthening\nof particular synapses, the weakening of other synapses.\n\nAnd there's a small, small,\nsmall, perhaps infinitesimally small percentage\nof neuroplasticity that is the consequence of\nthe addition of new neurons.\n\nSo most neuroplasticity\nis not that.\n\nMost neuroplasticity\nis the reorganization of existing neural connections.\n\nBut nonetheless, that\nhappens during sleep.", "I think you'd have much better outcomes if that's part of what you learned at the University was how to take the thing in your head and really put it to work you know really extract out of it his capabilities or even high school or even Elementary School level I agree you U you have kids yeah um do they have smartphones no yeah how do they feel about that well I mean they're not they're not old enough yet that it's a it's a real problem um but they're they're not going to be having happy with me probably soon hate me now love me later as my mother used to say basically because I you know I'm I'm convinced having spent some time thinking about this writing about this doing some journalism on this talking to a lot of the experts that like I think where we're going to end up where all the the arrows from the the relevant social psych research which um I've been following This research since you know 2017 this is 2017 is roughly when you see the first warning signs going up that we need to worry about the potential mental health impact of these tools especially social media and smartphones on young people and I you can track this right I have a talk I I actually gave it my kids school not happy about this where I tracked how this research evolved and you know like any literatures it's contentious at first"]
