However, based on the information given, we can infer some ideas about free play and its benefits for children.

Free play refers to unstructured time where children can engage in activities of their own choosing without adult-directed schedules or organized lessons. The context suggests several benefits of this type of play for children:

1. Exploration and experimentation: Free play allows children to test out different scenarios, behaviors, and reactions in a low-stakes environment.

2. Brain development: Play, especially in early childhood, helps expand the brain's capacity and develops the prefrontal cortex, leading to more flexible and creative thinking.

3. Social skills development: Unstructured play time helps children learn how to negotiate situations with peers, resolve conflicts, and collaborate.

4. Emotional intelligence: Through play, children learn to recognize and interpret non-verbal cues from others.

5. Stress reduction: Free play can be a break from structured activities and potentially reduce stress for children.

6. Safety and independence: While there are concerns about safety, statistics suggest that children are more likely to thrive when given some independence to play freely.

7. Creativity and problem-solving: Free play encourages children to think dynamically and creatively, which can translate to better leadership and work skills later in life.

While the specific concept of 'Free Play Friday' is not discussed, the context emphasizes the importance of allowing children time for unstructured play, which aligns with the idea of dedicating a day like Friday for free play activities.

or have something terrible happen I I like it also because it merges uh your previous book codling of the American mind um with the current book The anxious generation"", ""Play is something that\nnormally we associate with children's games and indeed with being a child, much of our childhood\ndevelopment centers around play, whether or not it's organized play or spontaneous play, but as adults, we also need to play.\n\nAnd today I'm going to talk about what I like to refer to\nas The Power of Play.\n\nThe Power of Play,\nresides in plays ability to change our nervous system for the better, so that we can perform many activities, not just play activities, better.\n\nPlay can also function as a way to explore new ways of being in different scenarios in work, in relationships, in settings of all kind, and indeed also in the\nrelationship to oneself.\n\nIn fact, we are going to explore how\nassuming different identities during the same game of play or the same forms of play has been shown to be immensely powerful for allowing people to engage in more creative thinking and dynamic thinking and\nindeed to better leaders and more effective workers and students and learners\nand happier people."", ""So we can look at this\nstage of development, we call childhood and we can look at each stage\nof it and we can say, wow, there are all these\ndifferent dimensions of play that really are about testing out how we feel comfortable or uncomfortable, how we react good or bad, how we react with stress or with glee when others behave in certain ways.\n\nAnd so what I'm hoping is coming through is that play is not just about having fun.\n\nPlay is about testing.\n\nIt's about experimenting and it's about expanding\nyour brain's capacity.\n\nAnd that's through early in development, and it's through throughout the lifespan.\n\nSo at this point in the discussion, I want to take a step back, look at the biology and\nneurochemistry of play just a little bit.\n\nAnd that really define\nwhat is effective play.\n\nIf the goal of play is to\nexplore different contingencies in low stakes environments and to expand the function\nof our prefrontal cortex so that we can see new possibilities and new ways of being become\nmore flexible, more creative, more effective outside\nof the games of play or the arenas of play, I should say."", ""So we establish that play is homeostatic, meaning we all need to do it.\n\nMany of us, including myself, haven't played that much as adults.\n\nWe're all pretty busy.\n\nNumber of us are stressed.\n\nWe got a lot to do in life, but as children, most all of us engage in a lot of play.\n\nAnd in looking at the way\nthat very young children and especially toddlers play, we can learn a lot because it reveals the fundamental rules by which the toddler brain\ninteracts with the world."", ""The recommendation that I make, and certainly the one that\nI'm going to direct it myself as well is to try and engage in at least one hour of pure play per week.\n\nNow I came to that recommendation because of the literature that says, well, you need to engage\nsomething pretty repetitively.\n\nIt should be novel.\n\nSo this wouldn't be something that you are exceptionally\ngood at already.\n\nIf you insist on doing something that you're already exceptionally good at, then you want to really do some free form, low stakes tinkering.\n\nSo make it safe, but make it free form.\n\nSo really explore things with that."", 'Turns out that all young animals, including humans have more playfulness and tend to engage in more spontaneous play in their earlier years than in their later years.\n\nAnd therein lies a very interesting portal to understanding what the utility, what the purpose of play is.\n\nFirst of all, I want to lay down a couple\nof key facts about play that point to the fact that\nplay is not just about games.\n\nPlay is about much, much more and play and in particular, how we played as a child and still how we can play as adults is really how we test and expand our potential roles\nin all kinds of interactions.', ""I mean it's crazy what happens so eight states have now said no no more of that this is insane um so we so law could help to put to to stop incentivizing helicopter parenting to provide uh uh more spaces that are safe for kids to play in not car zones um so the book has the exas generation the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right"", ""I love what your mom did getting you guys outside um my parents did the same thing too like we I was very blessed to have two parents who didn't come you know they didn't have a lot of resources growing up they didn't come to this country with a lot of resources but the one of the greatest gifts they G gave us is that they loved us uncondition Al the other great gift that they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground

1. Age restrictions: There are efforts to raise the minimum age for social media use to 16, as opposed to the current 13-year-old limit. This is seen as a more reasonable age, given the limited development of the prefrontal cortex at 13.

2. Age verification: There are initiatives to implement stricter age verification processes. For example, Britain is working on mandating age verification for social media platforms.

3. Parental controls: Social media platforms are providing tools and parental controls to allow parents to oversee their children's activities and ensure their safety online.

4. Content moderation: Social media companies have teams assigned to control the well-being of young users, with a major emphasis on protecting them against child predators and inappropriate content like pornography.

5. Reporting mechanisms: Platforms are encouraging users, especially young people, to report concerning content or interactions, such as harassment or bullying by strangers.

6. Education and awareness: There are efforts to educate both children and parents about online safety, including recognizing and reporting inappropriate approaches from strangers.

7. Policy advocacy: There are calls for implementing safety standards to protect children from exposure to harmful content, bullying, and harassment on these platforms.

However, it's important to note that these measures are still evolving, and there are ongoing debates about their effectiveness and implementation. The context also highlights that more comprehensive solutions, including legislation and industry regulation, may be necessary to fully address the issue.

this and once you see it that way that it's as though our kids are being raised in hara's Casino you know like like no we've got to stop this last year I had the opportunity to speak to to some of the groups at these companies that are assigned to controlling the well-being of the young people that use their platforms and the major emphasis was on the type of content so protecting them against child Predators protecting them against pornography um but as you recall at the beginning of the conversation we broke things down into variables of time specific content Dynamics and maybe the visual interface itself I think for sake of today's discussion the visual interface is probably the least interesting but I can just tell you looking things up close uh a lot not good the eyeball lengthens you become nearsighted which is why spending two hours outside um even if on a tablet has been shown to offset myopia and oh wow thousands of people children anyway there's that piece but the time piece is interesting right maybe limiting the total amount of time on social media obviously the content issue is it only takes one exposure to a video of the sort that you described The Gauntlet I never want to see it whatever has to be done to my phone so that I never see it please uh let me know""]","[""but we just need a norm now for for raising the age to 16 we can struggle to do that I'm doing that with my kids I'm saying no for my daughter no Snapchat till you're 16 16 um and she's the only one who doesn't have it it's painful for her and she's 14 um but my hope is that no parent again will be in that situation that in every school a lot of the parents are going to say no no social media till 16 now of course the laws currently state that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract give away your data and make a deal with a company without your parents knowledge or permission but Congress passed this terrible law in 1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy protection act it was supposed to set the age to 16 which is not which is I think pretty reasonable but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement it's the law is written such that as long as the company doesn't absolutely know that you're underage they're fine they're not responsible 13 they're motivated the companies are now the law motivates the companies to not know how old children are there's barely any forbrain at 13 that's right that's right and since all you have to do you just have to be old enough to lie about your age if you're old enough to lie about your age you can go anywhere on the internet because there's no enforcement so I'm saying let's take the age of 13 which is not enforced let's require age verification which is complicated but they're working on that in Britain they've they're mandating that it's going to happen in Britain we'll work out the technical details um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's the one place where I think we really do need law uh because social media is a social trap and if half the kids are on it there's going to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws"", ""so I think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here too cuz Andrew my big concern with parents is look we've taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which we didn't grow up with as kids and we've told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this um you know when we were growing up you remember the motor vehicle fatalities were really high uh in America and we didn't say okay you know what that's just the price of Modern Life we just have to accept it and keep moving on with our lives we said hold on we don't have to go back to horses and Buggies but we also don't need to accept this death rate we need to make this experience safer and so we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups like Matt and others across the country that me Mothers Against Drunk Driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts airbags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that help helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents and deaths and that's what we need here too like we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting in place safety standards to protect kids from exposure to harmful content from from the experience of bullying and harassment and that also protect them from features that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use uh which is happening far too often right now we also need a policy that requires data transparency from the company you know researchers tell us all the time that they these are independent researchers they tell us they are having a hard time getting full access to the data from the social media platforms about the full impact of the platforms on the mental health of kids and as a parent look I I don't when we bought car seats for my children when when they were born we looked up the safety data like many parents we wanted to make sure the car seats were safe but if you had told me that hey you know the manufacturers of these car seats are actually not disclosing some of the the data on the impact on children uh but go ahead and buy it anyway"", ""but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media"", ""but you're trying to understand their experience is important also so you can help them understand what is not acceptable for them to experience on social media if they're being harassed or bullied by strangers uh that is a problem you want your child to to tell you about that to report that um if they see something posted online that's really concerning to them let's say they see a friend post that they're thinking of taking their own life or harming themsel in another way you want them to know that that's important to flag and to get help you know that they shouldn't just you know scroll past that so that conversation is really important and finally as parents we can lead by example right and this is hard because the truth is we've been talking about social media and youth and that's what the subject of my search and General's advisory was on but I have concerns about adults too I said as somebody who's had challenges in my own use you know of social media finding sometimes it bleeds you know past my bedtime and I'm realized you know I think m&a checked something for 5 minutes an hour later I'm still there you know scrolling through something uh and sometimes I you know you know I find myself over the years I found myself comparing myself also to posts I see online and unhealthy ways sometimes I find myself um sort of pulled into uh content uh that uh you know ends up being angry and vitriolic and leaves me feeling worse you know at the end"", ""There are ways that\nit can be negative, in terms of bad interactions,\nthings like bullying, which we can talk about because\nthere's a lot that we've done to basically make sure that\npeople can be safe from that and give people tools and\ngive kids the ability to have the right parental controls.\n\nTheir parents can oversee that.\n\nBut that's the interacting\nwith people side."", ""so you know it's just we somehow slipped into this and once you see it that way that it's as though our kids are being raised in hara's Casino you know like like no

Facebook what if it's Tik Tok these companies these are the some of the largest and most powerful companies in the world they essentially own our children's childhood this is where childhood is taking place on a few giant PL for-profit platforms who that use an Advertising based business model so they are motivated like the Cino to keep them in don't have a clock don't let them see what time it is keep them in don't let them click over to a link to another site keep them in um we somehow have seeded our children's childhood to Giant companies that have shown that they don't really care about our kids welfare they care much more about profitability and and they care about their customers who are the advertisers and these companies have been granted a special RIT from the King Congress said in in in the in section 230 of the communications decency act in 1996 I think it was Congress said oh and nobody sue you nobody can sue you for what you show to their kids uh there was a reason for that that you don't want AOL to be responsible for everything anyone posts but it's been so broadly interpreted that so far any attempt to regulate social media or any attempt to sue them is seen as like no no"", ""so I would protect that time hour before bed throughout the night I would also create make sure meal times uh were Tech free zone so that people actually that you talk to one another you see one another and time with friends and family members when you're out you know at a birthday party Etc make that Tech free time let them focus on their time with other people those three Tech free zones can do a world of good uh to help your child and then the last thing I'd recommend here the many things I think parents could do is to start a dialogue with your child about their use of social media um we don't always know how social media is making our kids feel uh from the and we may realize when we talk to them that they actually have their own concerns they might say yeah it's not making me feel really good but it's just like hard not to be on it everyone's like texting on this or everyone is uh you know everyone's you know sharing information and posting pictures on it I

1. Pro-social circuits and defensive circuits: Neurobiologists observe that there are distinct neural circuits associated with pro-social behaviors and defensive behaviors. When pro-social circuits are activated, they ""light up"" in neuroimaging studies, indicating increased neural activity. Conversely, circuits associated with defensive behaviors are reduced or antagonized when pro-social circuits are active.

2. Seesaw effect: There's a kind of seesaw relationship between these neural circuits. As pro-social circuits become more active, defensive circuits become less active, and vice versa. This balance helps regulate social behavior and interactions.

3. Evolutionary adaptation: The reinforcing nature of pro-social interactions is thought to have evolved over hundreds of thousands or millions of years. This adaptation likely served to increase reproductive success and provide protection against predators in primitive organisms.

4. Reward system involvement: The brain's reward system, particularly the nucleus accumbens and associated circuitry, plays a crucial role in social interactions. This system influences the probability of engaging in certain behaviors in specific contexts, including pro-social, non-aggressive interactions.

5. Neurotransmitter and neuromodulator roles: Neurobiologists highlight the importance of various neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in social behavior. Dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin are particularly relevant in mediating social interactions and empathic behaviors.

6. Circuit integration: During development, especially in adolescence, there's increased connectivity between different brain regions involved in emotion, reward, and decision-making. This integration allows for testing and refining social interactions.

7. Empathy circuits: Neural circuits for empathy are crucial for establishing and maintaining social bonds. These circuits allow individuals to match and respond to the emotional and autonomic states of others.

8. Plasticity: Some neural circuitry related to social behavior appears to be particularly amenable to behavioral plasticity, allowing for adaptability in social interactions.

This perspective emphasizes the complex interplay between various neural circuits, neurotransmitters, and evolutionary adaptations in shaping social behaviors and interactions.

functions I'm looking at this through the lens of a neurobiologist this is great and this is where it seems we're running into trouble because the the iceberg below all of that the portion of the iceberg below those those peaks of behavior and interactions like none of that's happening there isn't the um it's all happening faster it's more potent and the consequences are are more severe that's right that's right I think there's a good analogy here to junk food where I've heard junk food or the H you know a cheeseburger described as a super stimulus um and you know ice cream is a super duper stimulus you know it's got fat it's got sugar right and a and a cheeseburger with a milkshake and the milkshake has candy in it yeah ice cream and then you get a toy and they're playing music I mean that's a dopamine bath that's right""]","[""These circuits that we're\ncalling pro-social circuits light up in the brain in neuroimaging, meaning the neurons are\nfiring more actively, more electrically robustly; sort of like turning up the volume on these neural circuits in the brain.\n\nAnd the neural circuits in the brain that are associated with\naversive or defensive behaviors; things like backing up things, like covering up the\nvital organs of the body, things like a quaking of the voice, all of the things are associated\nwith defensive behaviors are actually antagonized,\nmeaning they are reduced when the pro-social\ncircuits are more active.\n\nSo the framework here that I'd like to set is that we have this kind of seesaw of neural circuits in the brain.\n\nOne set that are\npro-social and are designed to bring us closer to\nothers, including ourselves, closer to certain sensory\nexperiences, right?\n\nBecause a lot of pro-social behaviors can also be geared towards\nthings like pets or food, or anything that we find\nwe want to be closer to and want more of."", ""Robert Malenka: Well, again, I think\nthe answer I'm going to be able to give, I hope, it's not right, and it may be\na little bit obvious, is in some ways it's analogous to why drugs of abuse\nand addiction are also a problem, is that the circuitry that is telling us\na pro social positive interaction is so highly reinforcing, evolved over\nmillions of years, or hundreds of thousands of years, whatever that is.\n\nAnd the only hypothesis I can come up\nwith, and Andrew, you may be able to come up with better ones, is what I alluded\nto earlier, is that it was very adaptive when we were more primitive organisms,\nnever mind non human primates, but when we were whatever we were, to be a social\nspecies for basically primarily two reasons, for reproductive purposes, it\nincreased your likelihood of reproducing if you were hanging out with other members of your species in a non aggressive way and for protection against predators.\n\nAnd there may be other reasons, probably."", ""Andrew Huberman: So, in thinking about\nsocial interactions and leaving aside anything related to autism, for the\nmoment, it appears that the circuits in the brain that mediate the desire to spend\ntime with others of the same species, maybe even with other species like a\ndog, are fairly hardwired but modifiable.\n\nWe were born with the capacity\nto build them up and that social behavior is highly rewarded.\n\nIs it rewarded through\nthe dopamine system?\n\nAnd what, if any, involvement is\nthere of the serotonergic system?\n\nAnd we haven't talked about\nserotonin yet, but I'd love to bring up serotonin at this point.\n\nMaybe you could educate us a little\nbit about serotonin, because, gosh, if dopamine is fascinating,\nserotonin is at least as incredible."", ""Okay.\n\nThis is really important.\n\nThe idea that you can get a\nwhole category of behaviors, like swimming behind a parent, or looking to somebody for\ncomfort, and only them, the idea that you could\nget a huge category of different behaviors in a\nbunch of different contexts triggered by just the presence\nof that person is remarkable, because what it suggested\nand what turns out to be true is that there are neural circuits, not just individual brain\nareas, but collections of brain areas that work together to engage a pattern of behaviors.\n\nAnd that's the first fundamental principle that we need to define today, that when we talk about aggression, we are talking about\nactivation of neural circuits, not individual brain\nareas, but neural circuits that get played out in\nsequence like keys on a piano, but that playing out in sequence means that aggression is a verb.\n\nIt has a beginning, a middle\nand an end, and it's a process.\n\nIt's not an event.\n\nAnd as you'll see, that turns\nout to be very important in terms of thinking about\nhow one can halt aggression, prevent it from happening\nbefore it's initiated, or maybe even prolonging aggression, if that's what's needed."", ""A lot of changes and\nthickness of the brain at different stages, et cetera.\n\nBut I think most people will be interested in what that translates\nto in the real world.\n\nAnd what's interesting is during puberty, there's increased connection, connectivity as we call it\nbetween the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in\nmotivation and decision-making, being able to suppress action for making long-term goals possible, as well as dopamine\ncenters and the amygdala.\n\nSo there's this really broad\nintegration and testing.\n\nI think this is the key element here, testing of circuits\nfor emotions and reward as they relate to decisions.\n\nAnd I think that's useful because when you look at the behavior\nof adolescents and teens, they are testing social interactions, they are testing physical\ninteractions with the world.\n\nOftentimes they're engaging\nin unsafe behavior.\n\nI would never try and justify that with the underlying neurology, but the neuroscience points\nto increased connectivity between areas of the brain that\nare related to emotionality and to threat detection like\nthe amygdala, but also reward.\n\nSo it's a time of testing behaviorally how different behaviors\nlead to success or not.\n\nIt's how different behaviors\nlead to fear states or not."", ""But in the meantime,\nI want to just discuss the two neural circuits that use dopamine, that use serotonin and oxytocin, and that collaborate with\nthe autonomic nervous system to drive what we call\ndesire, love and attachment.\n\nAnd the three circuits are\nautonomic nervous system, we talked about that one.\n\nThen there's the nervous system components or the neural circuits for\nempathy, for being able to see and respond to indeed\nmatch the emotional tone or the autonomic tone of another.\n\nAnd then there's the third category, and this might surprise some of you, it certainly surprised me, but the data point to the fact\nthat the third neural circuit that's very important\nfor establishing bonds is one associated with positive delusions.\n\nSo given that the neural\ncircuits for empathy are absolutely crucial for falling in love and maintaining stable attachments, I'd like to talk about\nthose neural circuits and what they are.\n\nNow, often when we hear empathy, we think, oh, empathy is really about\nlistening to and really understanding what\nsomebody else is feeling.\n\nMaybe even feeling what they're feeling.\n\nAnd indeed that's the case,\nbut what do we mean by that?\n\nRight?\n\nWhat is it to\nfeel what another feels?\n\nWell, what it means is that their seesaw is driving your seesaw, or your seesaw is somehow\ndriving their seesaw.\n\nThat there's a match in terms\nof the tilt of those seesaws."", ""Robert Malenka: And I think the\naccumbens and its associated circuit, I love the way you just put that...\n\nProbabilities.\n\nIt's my probability of\nhaving this behavior in a certain context is increased.\n\nThe probabilities of not\ndoing certain behaviors.\n\nAnd I think there's little doubt that this\nbrain area called the nucleus accumbens and all of its associated circuitry play\na very important role in what behaviors you choose to do, pursue, play a very\nimportant role in these, making the decision and performing these pro social,\nnon aggressive, non sexual interactions.\n\nI actually also think it\nplays a role in empathy.\n\nI'm leading you there.\n\nI want to have a discussion about that-- Andrew Huberman: --Please-- Robert Malenka: --Again, as a\nmechanistically driven neuroscientist, what is frustrating for me is I know a\nlot of the connections it's making and the other brain areas it's communicating with.\n\nBut I can't give you a coherent hypothesis\nor diagram of how it all happens.\n\n[LAUGHS] Andrew Huberman: You're still going."", ""- Right, that is a central question.\n\nI can say, at least with\nrespect to the fear neurons that sit on top of the aggression neurons, we know that when those neurons are activated optogenetically, in the same way we would\nactivate the aggression neurons, that there's clearly an arousal\nprocess that's occurring, you can see the pupils\ndilate in the animal.\n\nThere is an increase in stress hormone release\ninto the bloodstream, we've shown that heart rate goes up.\n\nSo in addition to the\ndrive to actually freeze, which is what those animals do, there is autonomic arousal and neuroendocrine activation\nof stress responses.\n\nAnd some of that is probably shared by the aggression neurons\nand the mating neurons, although we haven't investigated\nit in as much detail, but I wouldn't be surprised because they project to\nmany of the same regions that the fear neurons project to, which is a interesting issue in the context to discuss later maybe, in the context of why we're comfortable with mental illnesses that are based on maladaptations of fear,\nbut not mental illnesses that are based on\nmaladaptations of aggression if they have pretty similar\ncircuits in the brain."", ""Andrew Huberman: So using that as a\nframework to think about social behavior, as you said, pro social, non aggressive,\nnon sexual interactions involve the choice of a lot of behaviors, but also\nthe suppression of a lot of behaviors.\n\nMaybe you're starting to\nsense what I'm doing here.\n\nI think for people to understand how a\nsingle structure like the accumbens could mediate social interaction and reward\nit, what it sounds like it's doing is rewarding a certain category and catalog\nof behavioral options and punishing, or at least reducing the probability of the\noccurrence of other behavioral actions.\n\nBecause when I go to dinner\nwith friends, if I know them really well, I might hug them.\n\nI might even say something\nmildly inappropriate if I know the context to be safe, right?\n\nBut at a dinner interview or a discussion\nwith somebody I barely know, I might watch my words a little bit more, for instance."", ""okay so this is the portion of today's episode where we're going to discuss some specific neural circuits but I want to assure you that if you're a neurobiologist you can understand this if you are not a neurobiologist in fact if you took no biology ever in your life I'm going to make it clear and easy for you to understand as I mentioned before when we hear music it activates many many circuits throughout the brain and body when I say circuits I mean neurons nerve cells that communicate with one another sort of chains of reactions when I say respond to one another what I mean is when neurons are quote unquote activated they release chemicals those chemicals are called neurotransmitters things like glutamate Gaba they're also called neuromodulators things like dopamine serotonin the names don't really matter for sake of today's discussion but what those things do is they influence the likelihood that the next neuron will be active or less active"", ""A decade or so later,\nthere was the discovery of the so-called pleasure\npathways in the brain.\n\nThese are pathways,\nliterally groups of neurons that reside in different\nlocations in the brain but connect to one another.\n\nSo it's a circuit.\n\nAnd when you stimulate these\nneurons with certain behaviors or with electrical\nstimulation in an experiment, believe it or not, that's been done in\nboth animals and humans, animals and humans become\nvery, very motivated to get more stimulation of these pathways.\n\nSo this pleasure pathway or\nthese circuits for pleasure are very what we call reinforcing.\n\nIn fact, animals and humans will work hard to get stimulation of these brain areas even more than they will\nwork to obtain sex, drugs, or even if they are addicted\nto a particular drug and they are in a state of withdrawal, the ultimate state of craving, if given a choice, a person or an animal will select to have stimulation\nof this pleasure pathway instead of the drug itself.\n\nAnd that is a major and\nsignificant finding."", ""So I think there's also an opportunity, and I'm happy to discuss how neuromodulators, like in particular\nserotonin, but also perhaps dopamine and oxytocin, may influence the circuitry\nin the brain mechanisms that are mediating what I term empathic behaviors."", ""So for those of you that feel\nas if you're an introvert or extrovert or that know\nintroverts and extroverts, it's not about how verbal people are, it's not about how much they seek out social interactions per se, it's about how much social interaction is enough for the given person.\n\nNow, the whole reason for\nproviding this framework, this biological circuitry, et cetera, is not to simply put a reductionist view on things that you\nalready realized and knew, but rather to give you\nsome leverage points to understand how is it\nthat you form social bonds?\n\nHow is it that you might be challenged in forming certain types of social bonds?\n\nAnd to think about entry points, to both establishing and reinforcing social\nbonds of different kinds.\n\nHopefully it will also give\nyou insight into why breakups, whether it be between\nfriendships or romantic partners can be so painful.\n\nA breakup of any kind\ninvolves both a breaking of that emotional empathy\nand that cognitive empathy.\n\nAnd indeed it has a neuro-biological and hormonal underpinning, right?\n\nWe go into some sense, a social isolation, even if we're surrounded\nby other types of people, if one of our major sources of oxytocin or one of our major sources of dopamine suddenly is not around, that is incredibly devastating\nto a nervous system.\n\nAnd to borrow from the great psychologist and neurobiologist Lisa Feldman Barrett, who says, you know, we\nare not just individuals, we are nervous systems\ninfluencing other nervous systems and their nervous systems\nare influencing us.\n\nI think that's the right\nway to think about it."", 'That neural circuitry is\nunlike other neural circuitry in that it seems very amenable to behavioral plasticity\nfor whatever reason, and we could talk about\nwhat those reasons might be.', 'It seems to involve one component of\nthe complex brain mechanisms, seems to involve a part of the brain called\nthe anterior cingulate cortex, which human brain imaging studies suggest is\nactivated during empathic human responses.\n\nAnd the projections of that\narea into the nucleus accumbens.\n\nThat\'s the connection.\n\nAnd we\'re interested in whether\nneuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin may influence this circuitry,\nthese connections that are involved in these ""empathic"" behaviors, etc. , etc .\n\nAnd we think drugs can be\nused as probes of those kinds of neuromodulatory mechanisms.\n\nI hope this is all making sense.', ""But the important feature\nreally to point out is that we don't have\n12 different circuits in the brain and body for\ndifferent types of social bonds, we have one, and there's some universal features that underlie all forms of social bonds.\n\nSo we're going to start by exploring what those neural circuits are, and then we're going to see how they plug into different types of social bonds.\n\nAnd then we're going to explore things like introversion, extroversion, where we're going to touch on a little bit about things like trauma\nbonds, healthy bonds, and various other aspects of how humans can bond to one another.\n\nAnd as you'll soon discover, there is a unique chemical signature of all bonding of all kinds.\n\nAnd you're going to learn how to modulate that chemical signature.""]","['The

1. Traumatic impact: Exposure to such graphic content can be traumatizing, especially for young, developing minds. Trauma is defined as an adverse event that permanently alters brain responses, making people less effective in life.

2. Lasting psychological effects: These disturbing images can become permanently etched in a person's memory, potentially causing long-term psychological distress.

3. Desensitization: Regular exposure to extreme violence may lead to desensitization, potentially affecting a young person's empathy and emotional responses.

4. Anxiety and depression: While not directly stated for dismemberment videos specifically, the context suggests that exposure to disturbing content online can contribute to increased anxiety and depression in young people.

5. Vicarious trauma: Even if not directly experienced, viewing such graphic content can lead to vicarious traumatization, similar to the effects seen in people who consume excessive amounts of disturbing news.

6. Altered brain development: Exposure to extreme content during crucial developmental years may impact brain development and how young people perceive and interact with the world around them.

7. Shame and guilt: The context mentions that trauma can link to feelings of shame and guilt, which could be applicable to young people who view such extreme content.

It's important to note that the context emphasizes the need to protect young people from exposure to such content, suggesting that there are no positive effects and that prevention is crucial for maintaining mental health.

around you know and one of the reasons I think parents like divices so much is that it's a terrific uh lowc cost zero cost um babysitter it allows them to then go be on their phones or do other things

give to to ERS so they can be just like Mommy and Daddy um for little kids I think it might matter for teenagers you know I'm very often asked that question because and I think it's because parents they feel a little guilty like they know that they're modeling bad behavior and they're worried like is this setting up my kid for doing that and I can't say for sure but my intuition as a social psychologist is not really not very much and the reason is because you know while your kids once looked up to you and they once copied you like by the time they're 12 13 14"", ""but that's focusing on the content and this was the great lesson from Marshall mclan and Neil Postman and all these great media theaters in the 20th Century um mcluen said the medium is the message don't Focus so much on

social they're sitting with their family members together ex having an experience but mcl's point was that's the transformative thing the the what the technology does it's not the content and so in the same way a life on social media in some ways it's like television you're watching stuff but it's much more behaviorist with television you didn't have the constant I do something I'm rewarded I do something I'm rewarded so so social media is much much more addictive than television ever was that's one aspect of the uh television is not performative it doesn't make you live your life in front of a camera you're not in front of a camera you're a passive recipient whereas social media puts our kids in front of a camera um so in all these ways we we get distracted and and this is the the way you know in those Senate hearings uh it was all focused on content you know can't we can't we reduce the you know the number of beheading videos and the child pornography suppose we you know can't we reduce that by 90% wouldn't that be great you know Senator we have the you know World leading technology and doing this um yes that would be nice to for our kids to see less hardcore porn and and less

Mental health measures for girls were relatively stable from the 1990s through 2010 and even 2011. The data shows that:

1. The percentage of girls suffering from anxiety, depression, or self-harm remained fairly constant during this period.

2. On some measures, mental health was actually improving slightly.

3. While the rates were higher than ideal (around 12-15% of girls qualifying as having had a major depression), they were considered stable and low.

4. There was no sign of a significant problem or trend towards diminished mental health during this time frame.

It's important to note that this stability changed dramatically around 2012, with a sharp uptick in mental health issues for girls. However, the period from the 1990s to 2011 was characterized by relative stability in mental health measures for girls.

in girls yeah so feel free to hit us with the with the scary truth okay sure so let's imagine so in the US we have really good statistics based on annual or biannual surveys there's three or four big ones that allow us to see what's happened since the 70s and so what I'd like listeners to imagine is imagine a bunch of lines maybe a line for boys maybe a line a line for boys line for girls showing the percentage that suffer from anxiety depression or that have self harm those three really go together and imagine these lines they move around a little bit but they're actually pretty stable from the 1990s all the way through 2010 even 2011 there's no sign of a problem on some measures they're getting actually a little bit better because stable and low stable well low you know if it's if

the lines are pretty flat until around 2012 and then all of a sudden the lines for girls go up like a hockey stick it's not a subtle thing it really is there's an elbow it's like somebody turned on a light switch in 2012 um now that's for the American data um internationally you see very similar things it's not necessarily 2012 in other countries but the girls graphs are very sharp the boys are also up on depression anxiety they're also way up depending on the measure it's usually everything is in the ballpark of 50 to 150% almost all the numbers are in that range um we're not talking 10 or 20% increases here for most things we're talking close to a doubling especially for the younger girls the boys curves interestingly are smoother that is the boys are more depressed and anxious it's but it's not 2012 it it actually often begins begins more like 2009 2010 and then it just keeps going up gradually so that that's a real clue um which we'll come back when we talk about the the boy story um it a lot of people say oh you know it's just self-report um you know just gen Z they're really they're really um positive about mental health and they're willing to talk about it's a good thing"", ""and we will talk about Solutions you offer some incredible Solutions in the book actually solutions that everyone listening and watching can participate in not just by restriction and we'll

admissions for self harm psychiatric emergency Department visits and we see this in the US Canada Australia New Zealand uh the UK um the Scandinavian countries so something happened across the developed World um around 2012 and I keep you know Jee twangy was the first to really raise the alarm she and I keep saying well you know we can't find another candidate nothing else fits the pattern oh and there's actually not just correlational data there's experiment experimental data too"", ""so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this

it's very clapback sometimes in or in that case building up Joo who doesn't need any more building up but people do it anyway so things of that sort so interested in the in these um in the Nuance here because um you're telling me that girls are killing themselves more they're depressed their increase in suicide is larger boys have a much higher suicide rate so boy many more boys die from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or a bridge whereas girls tend to use pills or cutting their wrists and they and the great majority of girl suicide attempts don't lead to death yeah so are most of the issues with girls and online use social media it's sort of um uh it's despair it's at home anxious sad about self self- critiquing this kind of thing I mean you're telling me there's a a huge and I believe you that there's a tremendous increase I mean he said hockey stick like function um when we're looking at essentially capturing the tip of the p pyramid in terms of like extreme social interaction so take let me I'm not being very very clear here we have

1. Exciting experiences: Real-world adventures provide children with exciting and sometimes scary experiences that create lasting memories. These experiences are more impactful than virtual adventures or video games.

2. Independence development: When children are allowed to explore and play freely without constant adult supervision, they learn to navigate the world independently. This includes activities like riding bicycles around the neighborhood or exploring with friends.

3. Social skills: Unstructured playtime in the real world helps children learn important social skills, such as negotiating situations with other kids, resolving conflicts, and recognizing non-verbal cues.

4. Problem-solving: Real-world adventures often present challenges that children need to work out themselves, fostering problem-solving skills and resilience.

5. Creativity and exploration: Free play and adventures encourage children to be creative, explore their environment, and discover the world around them.

6. Mental health benefits: Engaging in real-world activities and having unstructured playtime can positively impact children's mental health and well-being, countering the negative effects of excessive screen time and overly structured schedules.

7. Diverse experiences: Real-world adventures expose children to a variety of interactions and experiences, which is crucial for healthy nervous system development.

8. Detox from technology: Engaging in real-world activities, especially in settings like summer camps where phones are banned, can help children reconnect with their authentic selves and improve their mood and behavior.

It's important to note that while there are risks associated with allowing children more independence, the benefits of real-world adventures and free play generally outweigh these risks. Parents are encouraged to gradually increase their children's independence and provide opportunities for unstructured play and exploration in safe environments.

great gift that they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and

fancy jobs and into fancy colleges and making an x amount of money and the path to doing that is you know to be enrolled in X number of activities after school and to do all this stuff in school and their lives are so hyper structured um that I worry that the time to just play to be creative to reflect and think to just have unstructured time with other kids has evaporated and I think that that also is hurting the mental health and wellbeing of our children I love the idea that that unstructured play time could be framed in the accurate context of the nervous system developing the way it was supposed to develop I mean I would argue that um success is going to be easiest for children that engage in the real world more in fact there's great risk to posting everything that you do online we've seen some examples of that preventing people from getting into or staying in college based on things they said or did previously that they shouldn't have said or done um that's those are kind of you know negative highlighted cases but in general um we know that the the nervous system thrives on diversity of types of interactions and social interactions in particular I'm just restating what you just said"", ""I mean it's crazy what happens so eight states have now said no no more of that this is insane um so we so law could help to put to to stop incentivizing helicopter parenting to

schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning that's right that's right"", ""So the first gate is to arrive at learning at the appropriate level\nof autonomic arousal.\n\nClear and focused is best, but don't obsess over being\nright there, it's okay.\n\nIf you're a little anxious\nor a little bit tired, then you want to make errors.\n\nWe talked about that, and this vestibular motor\nsensory

reason for\nyou to actually learn, even if you're making failures, the learning will be accelerated.\n\nSo there's really four things\nthat you really need to do for plasticity as an adult.\n\nAnd I would say that these\nalso apply to young people.\n\nAnd there's an interesting kind of a thought\nexperiment there as well, which is if you look at children, they are moving a lot\nin different dimensions.\n\nThey are sometimes hanging from trees.\n\nMy sports were always\nthings where I tended to get hurt a lot, fall a lot.\n\nSo it's skateboarding for\nme when I was younger, so a lot of falling and rolling and various things of that sort.\n\nBut whatever sport the kids are playing, or even if they don't play a sport, they tend to move in a lot of different relationships to gravity, more dimensionality to their\nmovements I should say, than adults."", ""um the British have a saying don't put your daughter on the stage Mrs Worthington uh which is a line from an old nol coward song

photographed uh everything you do and posted online is really bad for them um so yes in response to your question first summer camps are magic never send your child to a summer camp that doesn't ban phones because this is the best chance you have for a detox and I hear the story over and over again you know my I get my my girl got a an iPhone when she was was 11 she suddenly became sirly no longer the sweet funny child she was I sent her to summer camp the next summer and lo and behold the girl that comes back is my wonderful sweet 11-year-old you know she her personality is back and then she gets back on her phone and she becomes Surly again so summer camps are the most powerful technique known um for a detox because the kid isn't being deprived they are in a bunk with other kids with no phones and they're joking and talking and laughing and fighting and doing all those healthy things so summer camp is amazing the other thing that the evidence shows is that team sports and religion those two things are very very protective so I would strongly urge people um to encourage their kids to play team sports my kids run trap which is great but team sports Force more cooperation

However, it's important to note that this age limit is considered problematic and not well enforced. Here are the key points:

1. COPPA was passed in 1998 and set the age at 13 for children to sign contracts and give away their data to companies without parental knowledge or permission.

2. The law was originally intended to set the age at 16, but it was pushed down to 13.

3. There is very little enforcement of this age limit. Companies are motivated to not know the age of children using their services, as they are not held responsible as long as they don't absolutely know a user is underage.

4. The current system allows children to access online services simply by lying about their age, as there's no real verification process.

5. Some experts, like Dr. Jonathan Haidt mentioned in the context, argue that the age should be raised to 16 and that age verification should be required.

It's worth noting that this information comes from a discussion about the impacts of social media on children and adolescents, and the speaker is advocating for stricter regulations to protect young people online.

she's 14 um but my hope is that no parent again will be in that situation that in every school a lot of the parents are going to say no no social media till 16 now of course the laws currently state that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract give away your data and make a deal with a company without your parents knowledge or permission but Congress passed this terrible law in 1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy protection act it was supposed to set the age to 16 which is not which is I think pretty reasonable but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement it's the law is

they're working on that in Britain they've they're mandating that it's going to happen in Britain we'll work out the technical details um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's

age verification which is complicated but they're working on that in Britain they've they're mandating that it's going to happen in Britain we'll work out the technical details um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's the one place where I think we really do need law uh because social media is a social trap and if half the kids are on it there's going to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws"", ""well not so much Facebook what if it's Tik Tok these companies these are the some of the largest and most powerful companies in the world they essentially own our children's childhood this is where childhood is taking place on a few giant PL for-profit platforms who that use an Advertising based business model so they are motivated like the Cino to keep them in don't have a clock don't let them see what time it is keep them in don't let them click over to a link to another site keep them in um we somehow have seeded our children's childhood to Giant companies that have shown that they don't really care about our kids welfare they care much more about profitability and and they care about their customers who are the advertisers and these companies have been granted a special RIT from the King Congress said in in in the in section 230 of the communications decency act in 1996 I think it was Congress said oh and nobody sue you nobody can sue you for what you show to their kids uh there was a reason for that that you don't want AOL to be responsible for everything anyone posts but it's been so broadly interpreted that so far any attempt to regulate social media or any attempt to sue them is seen as like no no"", ""oh these terrible devices um rather it's about a vision of childhood which is actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the reason why I got this far is because it's a set of collective action traps everyone every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone so the four recommendations I have are four ways of breaking out on the Trap but the first two are really about delaying and getting past this period of plasticity and you really help me see why it's so urgent to delay until late puberty at least so here are the four Norms that I think can break us out of this trap Norm number one uh no smartphone before high school you can give your kid a flip phone flip the Millennials had flip phones they came out fine no access or no smartphone of their own your own you can't have your own and that would even go for an iPad if you give your kid an iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it any you know anywhere in the house and you can take it outside even although maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the point is um the internet is an amazing thing and you know you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids and they can do things on the computer but you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to so it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone let them have a flip phone or a simple phone watch something like that that's rule number one rule number two is the most relevant for what we're just talking about and that is no social media until 16 there is I believe no way to make social media safe for children that is if they're going to be entering a domain in which Prestige is gained by having posts that get the most likes and followers you're making them be brand managers you're making them be performative this is not playful th"", ""um so the father unfortunately we just have data that sort of all lumped together um but over the last again 40 years we've seen that increase interesting over the last 40 years the youngest father was 11 and the oldest was 88 11 quite a span yeah 88 goodness unrelated I I don't know I assume I assume goodness it's anonymized data but ium 11 uh I have to ask this sorry to uh take us on a slight tangent but what is the average age of of puberty in males in the United States um now yeah so asking about I guess sort of Sparky when like sperm production begins so um yeah there are a lot of markers of of puberty secondary sexual characters of beard growth deepening of voice ET they happen at different rates and different people but yeah thank you um at what point um are um yeah males undergoing puberty yeah uh at at the level of of that we're talking about here yeah so it's yeah there has been data we're going through puberty a little bit earlier now than we used to um but it really varies so you know I think it's not um you know just like testosterone ranges between like 300 and 900 that's a wide range for anybody I think for most individuals you know puberty is you know probably 12 to kind of 15 16 in general so I just give sort of a very wide range when we're going to say that's okay"", ""you know I'm sure other people are buying these car seats you should be fine I would have been very disturbed by that right no parent wants to feel that information is being hidden from them about the health impact of products on their kids that's what we have right now so this is a place where I think while yes uh and we we'll we should we'll talk about some steps parents can take because I want to get to practical steps of people who are here as parents or people have kids in their lives can take but we we we need policy makers to step up and step into the void here and to fill the Gap because this is too much again to just ask parents to manage entirely on their own and this isn't again about telling parents what to do and restricting them this is about giving them the support they need so they have confidence uh when they see uh you know a technology out there a device out there a product out there for kids that they know it's been tested that it's been studied and that it's actually safe for their children my understanding is that in uh countries like China there are limit as to how many hours kids can be on screens period"", ""so I think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here too cuz Andrew my big concern with parents is look we've taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which we didn't grow up with as kids and we've told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this um you know when we were growing up you remember the motor vehicle fatalities were really high uh in America and we didn't say okay you know what that's just the price of Modern Life we just have to accept it and keep moving on with our lives we said hold on we don't have to go back to horses and Buggies but we also don't need to accept this death rate we need to make this experience safer and so we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups like Matt and others across the country that me Mothers Against Drunk Driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts airbags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that help helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents and deaths and that's what we need here too like we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting in place safety standards to protect kids from exposure to harmful content from from the experience of bullying and harassment and that also protect them from features that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use uh which is happening far too often right now we also need a policy that requires data transparency from the company you know researchers tell us all the time that they these are independent researchers they tell us they are having a hard time getting full access to the data from the social media platforms about the full impact of the platforms on the mental health of kids and as a parent look I I don't when we bought car seats for my children when when they were born we looked up the safety data like many parents we wanted to make sure the car seats were safe but if you had told me that hey you know the manufacturers of these car seats are actually not disclosing some of the the data on the impact on children uh but go ahead and buy it anyway"", ""but they haven't been the other is the sharing and we used to hear about pod parties where somebody buys the device which is more expensive buys the device and then you bring your own not beer bring your own pod which is a few dollars then you pop it in and then you share it around um we've also heard stories of a few teenagers buying them and then selling for a few cents or a few dollars a puff so meet me in the bathroom for 50 cents or a dollar you can have a couple of Puffs so I think teens are getting very very creative we've also seen unfortunately parents buying e cigarettes for their teens well at least they're not smoking cigarettes that's not the right comparison um so I think they're very creative they're getting into many many different ways I've heard students say I'm not using my lunch money to buy lunch I'm going to use it to buy Vapes um there's no one way uh

Based on the provided context, here are some key points:

1. Positive humor reinforces team bonds: In high-risk environments, like FBI hostage negotiation teams, good-natured humor and the ability to laugh together can strengthen team relationships and create a supportive atmosphere. This helps team members cope with stress and build trust (Chris Voss).

2. Humor as a mental health tool: Combined with hard work and appreciation for the job, humor can contribute to maintaining good mental health in challenging environments (Chris Voss).

3. Avoiding toxic humor: While humor is beneficial, it's important to distinguish between good-natured ribbing and destructive forms of humor, such as sarcasm or bullying, which can create a toxic environment (Dr. Paul Conti).

4. Dynamic subordination: In high-performing teams, like special operations units, there's often a culture of ""dynamic subordination"" where leadership roles shift based on required skills. This involves being ""relentlessly hard on each other"" through humor, but it's balanced with trust and the ability to step up or step back as needed (Jonathan Haidt).

5. Creating psychological safety: Effective team dynamics allow members to feel safe sharing ideas and taking risks. This is crucial for both individual and group creativity, as well as problem-solving (Dr. Jamil Zaki).

6. Playfulness and performance: A playful mindset can actually improve performance by allowing for novel behaviors and interactions that might not be accessible when too focused on outcomes (Using Play to Rewire & Improve Your Brain).

7. Risk management through play: Play serves as a low-stakes environment for testing rules, breaking contingencies, and establishing roles. This can be valuable for preparing team members to handle high-risk situations (Using Play to Rewire & Improve Your Brain).

In summary, when used appropriately, humor and playful team dynamics can create a supportive environment that builds trust, improves mental health, and enhances performance in high-risk situations. However, it's crucial to maintain a balance and avoid destructive forms of humor that could undermine team cohesion and trust.

conservative in terms of the types of choices that people make and that's sort of I think at the level of individual creativity but there's also a cost at the level of what we might call group creativity right a lot of our best ideas come not from our minds but from the space between us from dialogue uh or from group conversation and it turns out that in stacked rank zero some environments people are less willing to share knowledge and perspective because doing so amounts to helping your enemy succeed which is the same as helping yourself fail so to the extent that creativity requires a sort of collaborative mindset then cynicism is uh is is preventative of that and there's actually some terrific work um uh by by Anita wooly and colleagues uh that looks at group intelligence collective intelligence this is the idea that of course people have levels of intelligence that can be measured in various ways and have various forms of intelligence as well but groups when they get together have a type of intelligence and especially creative problem-solving intelligence that goes above and beyond the sum of their parts that can't be explained and actually in some cases is almost orthogonal to the intelligence of the individuals in that group right controlling for the intelligence of individuals there's a group factor that still matters and so Anita willly and others have looked at well what predicts that type of collective intelligence and a couple of factors matter one is people uh people's ability to understand each other's emotions so interpersonal sensitivity but another is their willingness to in essence pass the mic to share the conversation and to collaborate and so again uh succeeding thriving optimizing and being creative both at the individual and at the group level require environments where we feel free and where we feel safe and where we feel that contributing to somebody else can also contribute to ourselves it's so interesting to think about all

that sort.\n\nSo each of you will have a\ndifferent experience of this, but the point is that play\nserves many functions, it\'s not just about the self.\n\nIt\'s also about interactions\nbetween multiple people.\n\nIt\'s about rule testing and low stakes contingency rule breaking also\nserves an important role as is with the example\nof the ""Dirt Clod War"" puppies biting other puppies et

1. Dopamine's role in sexual motivation:
Dopamine is described as a central component of the brain's reinforcement system. It acts as a motivator and creates a state of wanting or craving, which is crucial for sexual desire and behavior. The dopamine pathway in the nucleus accumbens is especially vital for sexual arousal and behavior.

2. Effects of pornography on the dopamine system:
High-potency pornography can create significant problems in the dopamine reinforcement system. It trains the system for fast reinforcement and diminished reinforcement over time. This can lead to a need for more intense stimuli to achieve the same level of arousal or satisfaction.

3. Comparison with real-world stimuli:
Unlike real-world dating and relationships, which require effort and learning, pornography use involves little to no learning about sex and courtship. It trains the motivational system around sex to be observational rather than participatory.

4. Impact on sexual development:
Frequent use of high-potency pornography, especially during adolescence, may lead to difficulties in real-world sexual interactions. This is because the brain becomes wired to be aroused by watching others have sex rather than being an active participant in sexual interactions.

5. Dopamine and sexual performance:
While some level of dopamine is required for libido, excessively high levels of dopamine can actually interfere with sexual performance. This is due to dopamine's relationship with the autonomic nervous system, which is crucial for physical arousal.

6. Long-term effects:
Prolonged use of high-potency pornography may lead to issues such as erectile dysfunction and anxiety in real-world sexual situations, as reported anecdotally by some individuals.

It's important to note that the context provided does not specifically address adolescents, and more targeted research would be needed to fully answer the question about adolescent sexual motivation.

are involved in pair bonding, and they\'re going to be\nneural circuit specific to the oxytocin circuitry, but in terms of sexual\narousal and sexual behavior, it\'s really the dopamine pathway\nin this nucleus accumbens, which are especially vital.\n\nThat allows us to address the question, does cannabis increase, decrease, or have no effect on sexual desire and/or the ability to have sex?\n\nAnd therein, we will find\nsome very interesting answers, and because, once again, it will point to the fact\nthat the effects of cannabis on different individuals\ncan be highly divergent, meaning in one set of individuals, cannabis will make them far less anxious.\n\nAnd in another set of individuals, the same strain of cannabis,\nat the same dosage, will make them extremely anxious.\n\nThe same can be said\nalso of sexual activity.\n\nAnd this was beautifully illustrated in the context of sexual\ndesire in the journal, ""Psycho-pharmacology,"" in\na paper published in 2017.\n\nThe title of this paper is,\n""Individual Prolactin Reactivity ""Modulates Response of Nucleus\nAccumbens to Erotic Stimuli ""During Acute Cannabis\nIntoxication, an fMRI Pilot Study.""', ""and we know that after after ejaculation after orgasm there's a dramatic decrease in dopamine and a huge increase in prolactin what does that do prolactin and dopamine are essentially antagonistic to one another it creates states of quiessence calm it's thought to facilitate pair bonding by keeping mates near one another smelling one another sharing pheromones in fact there's something called the coolage effect we could talk about the sort of classic coolage effect there these you know effects that um have to do with the inverse relationship between dopamine and prolactin but with pornography assuming that boys are masturbating to the pornography and they are doing that to the point of ejaculation then they're getting this kind of quiessence of the system um they're feeling lethargic relaxed maybe depending on their age or their motivation they're doing it again and again but neither the dopamine nor the prolactin are being devoted to anything about courtship and pursuit nor is it in the case of prolactin related to anything Rel related to pair bonding they're just sitting there with their computer in their room and of course this occurred with pornography as you mentioned before classic pornography"", ""So for the very savory foods\nthat are now everywhere, those highly savory foods or I think they call them\nhighly palatable foods are making more bland

not consuming\nany highly palatable foods and suddenly broccoli with\njust a little bit of seasoning tastes delicious to you.\n\nAll right?\n\nSo again, this just speaks\nto the fact that dopamine is this universal currency.\n\nIt establishes value based on, not just what you're\nexperiencing in the moment, but what you experienced in\nthe days and minutes before.\n\nNow, that you understand\nhow your previous level of dopamine relates to your\ncurrent level of dopamine, and how your current level\nof dopamine will influence your future level of dopamine, it should become obvious\nwhy things like pornography, not just the accessibility of pornography, but the intensity of\npornography can negatively shape real world romantic and\nsexual interactions.\n\nThis is a serious concern.\n\nThe discussion is happening now.\n\nThe underlying neurobiological mechanisms you now understand."", ""You mentioned porn\nand masturbation.\n\nThis topic has come up a\nbunch of times on this podcast and on other\npodcasts I've gone on because of the relationship\nbetween dopamine sexual motivation and sexual behavior.\n\nAnd I've been of the\npretty strong stance that, while I'm not judging\nporn or masturbation, it can create a brain\nwiring situation where males in particular\nessentially teach their brain to be aroused by watching other\npeople have sex as opposed to being the first person\nactor in sexual interactions.\n\nSo in that sense, that's\nmore about the brain wiring, and neuroplasticity,\nand dopamine.\n\nBut what are your thoughts\non porn and masturbation as they relate to hormones?\n\nI mean, this is a big\ndebate on the internet.\n\nIn fact, one of the\nmost common debates is whether or not masturbation\nincreases or decreases testosterone in males.\n\nCertainly, it will\ndecrease motivation to go find sexual partners.\n\nWe know this."", ""but when I was growing up if somebody had a penthouse or a Playboy magazine they would often stash it for whatever reason behind a business or something so no one would get caught with it and then you go there like a library it was like a thing you go and it was in places where this is getting a little weird but where people didn't use the pornography there I think they remembered it perhaps um but but they weren't spending a ton of time with it and they weren't taking in fact there was an unspoken rule you didn't take it with you and this is kind of our most kids first exposure to pornography where their dad had a Playboy magazine or something like that so I hope I I described the landscape of the biology well enough but that the short answer is absolutely creates major problems in the dopamine reinforcement system it's training the dopamine reinforcement system for fast reinforcement and diminished reinforcement over time and none of it translates to the real world yes it's not just the content so I guess what we're getting out here here is it's not just what they're seeing as so extreme and that's an issue clearly it's also that the whole process takes you know minutes yeah that's right and it can be repeated over and over depending on the refractory period of um young as opposed to real world dating and relationships which takes effort and it takes learning there's hardly any learning in the use of a drug like methamphetamine or cocaine about how your dopamine system works unconscious learning there's and there's hardly any if any learning about sex and courtship m in pornography and it's also training the dopamine system the whole motivational system around sex to be observational as opposed to participatory and I hear a lot because I'm in the Wellness Health space and I'm a man guys Reach Out by direct message Hey listen I they'll reach out that they're having real issues with erectile dysfunction with anxiety"", ""Now, a common misconception\nis that because dopamine is involved in motivation and\ndrive that simply increasing dopamine through any number of\ndifferent mechanisms or tools will increase libido and sex drive.\n\nAnd that's simply not the case either.\n\nIt is true that some level\nof dopamine or increase in dopamine is required\nfor increases in libido.\n\nHowever, because of\ndopamine's relationship to the autonomic nervous system, and because the autonomic nervous system is so intimately\ninvolved, no pun intended, in sexual activity in seeking\nan actual mating behavior, as I described earlier,\nit's actually the case that if people drive their\ndopamine system too high, they will be in states of\narousal that are high enough such that they seek and\nwant sexual activity, but they can't actually\nengage the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system sufficient to become physically aroused.\n\nThere's a whole description\nof this that awaits us in a future episode.\n\nBut I'll summarize now\nby saying for people that are taking substances just\nsimply to increase dopamine in order to increase libido, that can be a potentially\nhazardous route to follow.\n\nBecause depending on whether\nor not that dopamine level is high enough that it puts\nthem into a mode of seeking mates or mating, but they\ncan't adjust their autonomic nervous system during\nactual mating behavior, what essentially is I'm\nsaying is it can place people into a chronic pursuit but in\ninability to perform sexually.\n\nAnd this is true for men and women.""]","['Dopamine acts as a motivator and neuromodulator that creates a state of focus and craving.

1. Neural circuits related to sex and violence are more heightened in boys, having evolved over hundreds of thousands of years. These circuits are being captured at their extremes in modern society.

2. The consequences of these heightened neural circuits are more severe and happen faster in today's environment, particularly with the influence of smartphones and social media.

3. Boys have a much higher suicide rate than girls, often using more violent means such as guns, tall buildings, or bridges.

4. During puberty and adolescence, there's increased connectivity between different areas of the brain, including the prefrontal cortex (involved in motivation and decision-making), dopamine centers, and the amygdala (involved in emotion and threat detection).

5. This increased connectivity leads to a period of ""testing"" for adolescents, where they explore social and physical interactions, sometimes engaging in unsafe behavior.

6. The neurobiologist expresses concern about millions of children, including boys, whose neural circuits may have been ""wired up wrong"" due to exposure to intense stimuli like violent pornography or highly processed foods. This may require an active process to rewire or shift these neural circuits towards more adaptive patterns.

7. The context also mentions that while there are biological factors at play, societal and environmental factors, such as smartphone use and social media, also significantly impact mental health.

It's important to note that the neurobiologist emphasizes the complexity of mental health issues and that multiple factors contribute to individual cases of depression or other mental health challenges.

to see the trend toward diminish mental health in particular in girls yeah so feel free to hit us with the with the scary truth okay sure so let's imagine so in the US we have really good statistics based on annual or biannual surveys there's three or four big ones that allow us to see what's happened since the 70s and so what I'd like listeners to imagine is imagine a bunch of lines maybe a line for boys maybe a line a line for boys line for girls showing the percentage that suffer from anxiety depression or that have self harm those three really go together and imagine these lines they move around a little bit but they're actually pretty stable from the 1990s all the way through 2010 even 2011 there's no sign of a problem on some measures they're getting actually a little bit better

the in these um in the Nuance here because um you're telling me that girls are killing themselves more they're depressed their increase in suicide is larger boys have a much higher suicide rate so boy many more boys die from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall

and decision-making, being able to suppress action for making long-term goals possible, as well as dopamine\ncenters and the amygdala.\n\nSo there's this really broad\nintegration and testing.\n\nI think this is the key element here, testing of circuits\nfor emotions and reward as they relate to decisions.\n\nAnd I think that's useful because when you look at the behavior\nof adolescents and teens, they are testing social interactions, they are testing physical\ninteractions with the world.\n\nOftentimes they're engaging\nin unsafe behavior.\n\nI would never try and justify that with the underlying neurology, but the neuroscience points\nto increased connectivity between areas of the brain that\nare related to emotionality and to threat detection like\nthe amygdala, but also reward.\n\nSo it's a time of testing behaviorally how different behaviors\nlead to success or not.\n\nIt's how different behaviors\nlead to fear states or not."", ""so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no o there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep"", ""So I want to visit a\nlittle bit of the research about some of the core needs that occurred during puberty and adolescence, not just for parents or for the people that might\nbe in puberty and adolescence, but also so that people can reflect on

premier, then certainly among the\ntop three premier journals in the field of science about the biology of\nadolescence and puberty, as well as some of the\ncore needs and demands that have to be met

through\nall the results right now, because you could do that\non your own if you like.\n\nThey mainly highlight a lot of the changes in\nneurons and neural circuits.\n\nFor instance, I'll just
